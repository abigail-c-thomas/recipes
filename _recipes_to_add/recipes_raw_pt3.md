## **Salads** {#salads}

Leafy greens were eaten at the start of meals. All three menus included in Martial’s epigrams, for instance, open with lettuce accompanied by leeks, as does Pliny the Younger’s menu. Though they don’t state whether the lettuce was dressed, recipes from *Apicius* and comments from Galen imply that dressing with olive oil, vinegar, honey and/or *liquamen* was common. 

Lettuce was considered potentially indigestible. *Apicius 3.18.2* recommends an *oxyporium,* a highly-spiced mixture served with *oxygarum*, that is, vinegar and *liquamen*, in order to aid digestion. Columella includes another two recipes for *oxyporium*.

### Leafy greens {#leafy-greens}

Apicius 3.16a

**Ingredients**

* Head romaine lettuce, rocket, endives, chicory, or other leafy greens  
* Olive oil  
* Fish sauce  
* Red wine vinegar

**Method**  
Wash and dry the lettuce leaves, and break into large bite-size pieces into a salad bowl. Drizzle with olive oil, fish sauce, and vinegar, and serve.

**Notes**

* Galen says that people eat boiled lettuce with this same combination of olive oil, fish sauce, and vinegar  
* Lettuce and rocket were a popular combination, as noted by Pliny the Elder and by Galen. Lettuce was considered cooling, and to be a sedative, while rocket was warming and an aphrodisiac, so the two balanced each other out.

### Endives or Lettuce {#endives-or-lettuce}

Apicius 3.18.1a

**Ingredients**

* Head romaine lettuce (or an endive)  
* Half of a small white onion, thinly sliced  
* Olive oil  
* Fish sauce

**Method**  
Wash and dry the lettuce leaves, and break into large bite-size pieces into a salad bowl. Add the thinly sliced onion. Drizzle with fish sauce and olive oil, toss, and serve.

**Notes**

* The recipe is for endives, but then suggests that endives are a good substitute for lettuce in winter. Given that endives are hard to find I suggest substituting with romaine lettuce.

### *Oxyporium* {#oxyporium}

Apicius 1.32 and 3.18.2

**Ingredients**

* 2 tsp ground cumin  
* 1 tsp ground ginger  
* 1 tsp ground pepper  
* ½ tsp dried rue  
* Half a date, finely chopped  
* 60g honey  
* 30ml vinegar  
* 20ml fish sauce

**Method**  
Mix all the ingredients together and let sit for half an hour, then strain through a sieve if desired. Serve with lettuce as a salad dressing, or consume alongside lettuce by the teaspoon. 

**Notes**

* In the original recipe, quantities are given for everything but the vinegar and fish sauce, which is unusual for ancient culinary recipes but common in medicina recipes. I’ve used a 2:1 honey to vinegar ratio, which is common in other recipes. *Oxygarum* is usually equal parts vinegar to fish sauce, but modern fish sauce is likely stronger than what the ancient Romans used so I’ve reduced the quantity of fish sauce somewhat.  
* This recipe is duplicated in Apicius, with 3.18.2 giving further details and stating that the *oxyporum* should be served with lettuce, to render the lettuce harmless. 

### *Oxyporium* {#oxyporium-1}

Columella 12.59e

**Ingredients**

* 1 tsp white pepper  
* ½ tsp celery seed  
* ½ tsp laser root  
* 1 tsp ground parmesan  
* 1 Tb honey

**Method**  
Mix all the ingredients together. Serve with lettuce as a salad dressing, or consume alongside lettuce by the teaspoon. 

### *Oxyporium* {#oxyporium-2}

Columella 12.59f

**Ingredients**

* ½ tsp white pepper  
* ½ tsp dried mint  
* ½ tsp lovage  
* ½ tsp raising, finely chopped  
* 2 Tb honey  
* 1 Tb red wine vinegar  
* 2 tsp fish sauce

**Method**  
Mix all the ingredients together. Serve with lettuce as a salad dressing, or consume alongside lettuce by the teaspoon. 

### Cabbage Salad {#cabbage-salad}

Mnesitheus, quoted in Oribasius *Medical Collections* 4.4.1, and Cato *De Agricultura*, 157

**Ingredients**

* 1 small cabbage  
* 2 tsp fresh rue, finely chopped  
* 3 tsp coriander leaf, chopped  
* ½  tsp asafoetida  
* 3 Tb honey  
* 1 Tb red wine vinegar  
* Salt

**Method**

1. Finely slice the cabbage, and toss together with the herbs, salt, and asafoetida.  
2. Mix together the honey and the vinegar. Pour over the salad, toss everything together, and serve.

**Notes**

* This recipe appears both in Oribasius, from the 4th century AD, but likely quoting from the (now lost) works of Mnesitheus, who lived in the 4th century BC  
* The recipe also appears in Cato, as well as in Pliny’s *Natural Historia* in which Pliny used Cato as a source.  
* The recipe is medicinal \- it can allegedly cure headaches and is good for upset stomachs, at least, so says Pliny.

### Radishes {#radishes}

Apicius 3.14

**Ingredients**

* 5 medium radishes  
* 1 tsp fish sauce  
* ½ tsp black peppercorns

**Method**  
Slice the radishes. Ground the pepper corns with the fish sauce in a mortar and pestle, drizzle over the radishes, and serve.

* 1 tsp ground cumin  
* ½ tsp asafoetida  
* ½ tsp dried rue  
* 3 Tb red wine vinegar  
* 1 Tb liquamen  
* 1 Tb *defrutum*

**Method**

1. Cut the squash into large pieces then boil until *al dente*. Remove from the water and place in a dutch oven  
2. Mix the remaining ingredients together, then pour over the squash. Bring to a simmer and cook for a few minutes, sprinkle with pepper, and serve. 

### Gourd {#gourd-1}

Apicius 3.4.2

**Ingredients**

* 500 g squash (or gourd, if you can find it)  
* ½ tsp ground pepper  
* 1 tsp ground cumin  
* ½ tsp dried rue

* 1½  Tb red wine vinegar  
* 1 Tb liquamen  
* ½ Tb olive oil  
* 2 tsp cornstarch

**Method**

1. Cut the squash into large pieces then boil until *al dente*. Remove from the water and place in a dutch oven  
2. Mix together all other ingredients except the cornstarch slurry and pour over the squash. Bring to a simmer and cook for a few minutes.  
3. Add the cornstarch slurry. Thicken for a couple minutes, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

**Notes**

* This is very similar both to the previous recipe, the main differences being the absence of *laser* and the thickening of the sauce  
* This is also very similar to *Apicius* 7.15, which is a sauce of taro differing only in the substitution of honey instead of vinegar

### Alexandrian Gourd {#alexandrian-gourd}

Apicius 3.4.3

**Ingredients**

**Method**

1. Cut the squash into large pieces then boil until *al dente*. Remove from the water and place in a baking dish.  
2. Place the dates in a bowl along with a little water, and microwave for a minute. Place a food processor along with the pine nuts, and blend into a coarse paste.  
3. Add the remaining ingredients to the food processor, and blend together.  
4. Pour the sauce over the squash, then cover with a lid or foil. Place in a preheated oven at 180 C / 350 F for 15 minutes, or until reheated. Season with pepper and serve.

**Method**

1. Arrange the cucumber slices in a shallow dish. Combine the other ingredients together and pour over the cucumber. Cover the dish with cling wrap and leave in the fridge for a couple of hours.

**Notes**

* The recipe calls for either *passum* or honey. If using honey rather than passum add 2 Tb honey  
* The recipe itself states that adding *silphium* is optional, so you can omit this if you like

**Notes**

* On reflection I think these should be mashes, see Vinidarius 7 for similar but more detailed instructions

### Celery Mash {#celery-mash}

Apicius 3.15.2

**Ingredients**

* 1 head of celery  
* 1 onions, peeled and cut in half

2. Drain the water from the saucepan, then leave the celery and onions to cool for a few minutes.  
3. Place the celery and onions into a food processor along with the remaining ingredients and puree  
4. Pour the puree into a saucepan. Bring gently to heat for a few minutes, then serve

### Lettuce Mash {#lettuce-mash}

*Holus molle ex foliis lactucarum*, Apicius 3.15.3

**Ingredients**

* 1 head of lettuce  
* 2 onions, peeled and cut in half  
* 1 tsp baking soda  
* Pepper  
* ½ tsp dried lovage  
* ½ tsp celery seeds, ground in mortar and pestle  
* 1 tsp dried mint  
* 2 Tb fish sauce  
* 2 Tb olive oil  
* 2 Tb white wine

**Method**

1. Place the lettuce, onions, and baking soda in a large saucepan. Cover in water, bring to the boil, and then simmer for 15 minutes.  
2. Drain the water from the saucepan, then leave the lettuce and onions to cool for a few minutes.  
3. Once cool enough to handle, squeeze as much liquid as you can out of the lettuce and onions, then finely dice and place into a serving bowl.  
4. Mix together the pepper, herbs, fish sauce, olive oil, and wine, then pour over puree. Toss the mixture and serve.

**Notes**

* Recipes 3.15.1 and 3.15.2 give very similar recipes for pureed alexanders and celery, also cooked in soda. Recipe 3.1 simple states that leaf vegetables become emerald green if cooked in soda.   
* Pliny notes that the Apician method for cooking cabbage is with soda, which helps them retain their colour.  
* It is unclear if the onion is supposed to be cooked with the cabbage. In the Grainger & Grocock text the onions are cooked, but the other texts bracket the heading differently to imply that the onions are not cooked.

### Sauteed Greens {#sauteed-greens}

*Rapas*, Apicius 3.16b

**Ingredients**

**Ingredients**

* 1 globe artichoke bulb  
* 1½   Tb olive oil  
* 2 tsp fish sauce  
* A pinch of cumin

**Method**

1. Steam the artichoke for 25–35 minutes, until the outer leaves can easily be pulled off. Alternatively, wrap the artichoke in damp paper towels and microwave for 10 minutes.  
2. Mix together the remaining ingredients in a small bowl. Dip the leaves and eat the normal way, then remove the choke and eat the heart with the sauce.

**Notes**

* This recipe was originally for cardoons, of which the artichoke is a cultivated variety. It’s unclear whether the ancient Romans cultivated artichokes or consumed wild cardoons, but since cardoons are difficult to find I’ve substituted the artichokes instead. 

### Carrots {#carrots}

Apicius 3.21.3

**Ingredients**

**Notes**

* Last time I made this the taro turned to mush

* 3 tsp sumac  
* 2 tsp ground coriander seed  
* A small bunch of coriander leaf, loosely chopped

**Method**

1. Bring 500 ml of water to the boil. Add the lentils and cook for about 45 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through and become mushy. Stir occasionally to prevent lentils sticking, and add more water as needed to prevent them drying out.  
2. Add the vinegar, olive oil, sumac, and coriander seed along with a generous pinch of salt. Stir everything together and taste, seasoning with extra salt and olive oil if desired, and allow to simmer for an additional few minutes. Garnish with the coriander leaf and serve.

**Notes**  
This recipe works really well with fish sauce instead of salt. Anthimus would not approve, but it certainly tastes good\!

### Libum {#libum}

*De Agricultura* 75

**Ingredients**

* 250g ricotta  
* 125g whole wheat flour  
* 1 egg  
* Bay leaves  
* Olive oil  
* Honey for serving

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 180 C  
2. Thoroughly mix together the ricotta, flour, and eggs along with a pinch of salt. Shape into a round loaf.  
3. Lightly grease a small dutch oven with a little olive oil. Lightly coat the bay leaves in olive oil then place to cover the bottom of the dutch oven. Put the loaf on top, and then bake with the lid on for about 1.5 hours, until golden and firm.  
4. Once baked, cut into slices, cover in honey, and serve immediately.

**Notes**

* *Libum* was sometimes used to refer to the sacrificial cakes offered to household spirits, which may explain why Cato included a recipe in his work on agriculture. Cato does not say to serve with honey, but as noted in *The Classical Cookbook* all other ancient authors associate the cake with honey, and it certainly tastes better this way. 

### Savillum {#savillum}

*De Agricultura 84*  
**Ingredients**

* 750 g ricotta  
* 150 g white flour  
* 75 g of honey, plus additional for serving

* Poppy seeds

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F  
2. In a mixing bowl, mix together the ricotta, flour, honey, and egg, until well-combined  
3. Grease a deep pie dish or cake pan. Pour the cake batter into the dish, then place in the oven and bake for 60 minutes.  
4. Once 60 minutes have passed, check whether the cake is cooked through by sticking a skewer through the middle — it should come out clean. If not, continue baking until cooked through.  
5. Once the cake is cooked, take it out of the oven. Cover it in the honey, sprinkle over poppy seeds, and then place back into the oven for a final 10 minutes. Serve immediately.

3. Heat olive oil in a fry pan or wok. Cut the flour mixture into small fritters, then fry a batch of the fritters until golden brown on both sides. Place on a paper towel to cool while you cook the remaining fritter.  
4. Once all the fritters are cooked, serve coated in honey and sprinkled with ground pepper.

**Notes**

* The suggestion to add olive oil to the plain flour and milk mixture comes from Sally Grainger; it helps firm up the batter  
* Could be interesting to try using semolina rather than plain flour
