### Whitebait Patina {#whitebait-patina}

*Patina de apua fricta*, Apicius 4.2.20

**Ingredients**

* 250g small fry (or any white fish fillet, broken into chunks)  
* 4 eggs  
* 30 ml olive oil  
* 30 ml white wine  
* 20 ml fish sauce  
* Pepper

**Method**

1. Whisk the eggs, then mix together with the fish.  
2. Add the oil, wine, and fish sauce to a frying pan and bring to a simmer. Pour the egg and fish into the pan and cook.  
3. Once the underside has nicely browned, flip the omelette. Cook until the other side is also browned and the omelette is cooked through. Turn onto a plate, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

**Notes**

* Recipe 4.2.20 and 4.2.26 are very similar, though 4.2.26 calls for *lagita* fish to be used. This fish might refer to the horse-mackerel, but the identification is unclear.  
* The recipe calls for a simple *oenogarum* to be poured on top of the omelette. I am not sure if this refers to the olive oil/wine/fish sauce mixture that the omelette is cooked in, or an additional *oenogarum* prepared separately. Here I have chosen the former interpretation. 

### Patina of Sole

Apicius 4.2.28

**Ingredients**

* 300g fillets of sole  
* 20 ml fish sauce  
* 15 ml olive oil  
* 45 ml white wine  
* 4 eggs  
* Pinch of lovage  
* Pinch of oregano  
* Pepper

**Method**

1. Place the sole fillets in a frying pan along with the fish sauce, olive oil, and white wine. Gently bring to heat and poach the sole fillets until they are cooked through, then remove from heat and allow to cool.  
2. Whisk together the eggs, lovage, and oregano along with a generous grind of black pepper. Pour over the sole and gently mix so that the eggs and cooking liquor combine.  
3. Place the frying pan back over the heat and cook gently until the egg mixture is set. If you like, once the egg mixture is mostly cooked you can place the frying pan under the broiler to set the top. 

**Notes**

* As an alternative to cooking the *patina* over the stove, you can instead perform the last step in an oven. Transfer the cooked sole, cooking liquor, and egg mixture to an oven-proof dish, and then bake at 350F/180C for 20–25 minutes, until the egg mixture is just set.

## ***Ofellae*** {#ofellae}

*Ofellae* is a Latin word referring to marinated bite-sized pieces of meat that have been cooked in a richly-flavoured sauce. We have ten surviving recipes for *ofellae*—six from Apicius, Book 7, and a further four from Vinidarius. While some of the recipes are vague, they seem to involve a two-step cooking process. The meat is first slowly roasted or boiled, and then afterwards quickly “fried” in a flavorful sauce. The final dish should be succulent and tender, somewhat similar to modern BBQ or braised dishes; one of Martial’s epigrams mentions *ofellae* so tender that they do not need a carver to slice the meat.

*Ofellae* were a staple of taverns, and the Emperor Claudius even rhetorically asked “Who can life without *offulae*?” in a Senate discussion on cookshops. Given the two-step nature of the cooking process, my guess is that in these taverns the slow cooked meat would have been prepared ahead of time, and when *offellae* was ordered the simple reheated in the sauce. This method also works well with these recipes below.

### Ostian *Ofellae* {#ostian-ofellae}

Apicius 7.4.1

**Ingredients**  
*For marinade:*

* 1 kg pork belly  
* 1½ tsp ground black pepper   
* ½ tsp lovage leaf  
* 3 tsp dill seed  
* 3 tsp cumin seed   
* ½ tsp asafoetida  
* 2 bay berries  
* 45 ml fish sauce

*For sauce:*

* 150 ml *passum*  
* 30 ml fish sauce  
* ½ tsp lovage  
* Generous ground black pepper  
* 1 Tb cornstarch, made into slurry

**Method**

1. Dry roast and grind the seeds in the marinade, then combine with the lovage, asafoetida, and fish sauce  
2. Place the meat skin side down. Score the meat by cutting through the meat down to, but not through, the skin, in parallel lines 3 cm apart. Then cut meat orthogonally, again not cutting through the skin, to get a grid of 3cm x 3cm squares. Cover the meat with the marinade and place covered in the fridge for 3 days.  
3. Once the meat has marinated and you are ready to cook it, preheat the oven to 190C / 375F. Rub a little olive oil over the meat, and place on a roasting tray. Roast for 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until the meat is well-done and can be easily pulled from the skin. Once cooked, take out to rest while you prepare the sauce  
4. Place the *passum*, fish sauce, lovage, and pepper in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Simmer for a few minutes, then add the cornstarch slurry to thicken.  
5. Cut the meat into pieces, and serve with the sauce.

### Apician *Ofellae* {#apician-ofellae}

Apicius 7.4.2

**Ingredients**

* 750 g pork belly  
* 150 ml *passum*  
* 45 ml fish sauce  
* 1 Tb olive oil  
* 8 tiger nuts, crushed  
* 2 tsp cumin  
* ½ tsp lovage  
* Ground pepper

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 200C. Roast the pork belly in the oven until well done, about 1 hr. Once pork belly is cooked, remove from the oven and slice into 3cm x 3cm chunks  
2. Place the pork along with the remaining ingredients into a saucepan. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking until the sauce has mostly evaporated, and clings to the meat. Remove the meat from the saucepan, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

**Notes**

* Tiger nuts don’t have any close substitutes. Almonds are probably the closest substitute — I would suggest using a 2 tsp almond meal. Sally Grainger suggests 1 tsp ground ginger, which results in a pleasant taste but to my palate one that is fairly different from using tiger nuts.  
* This recipe appears to be a fairly “typical” form of *ofellae*: the meat is first roasted or boiled, then separate “fried” and served in an *oenogarum*. Apicius 7.4.5 and and Vinidarius 4 give generic instructions of this form, but ingredients for the *oenogarum* are not specified. One could simply omit the tiger nuts (and, optionally, cumin) to recreate these more “generic” *ofellae* recipes. 

### Wild-Boar Style *Ofellae* {#wild-boar-style-ofellae}

Apicius 7.4.3

**Ingredients**

* 750 g pork belly  
* 2 tsp ground cumin  
* 2 tsp ground coriander  
* 1 tsp ground mustard seed  
* ½ tsp ground fennel seed  
* ½ tsp ground pepper  
* 90 g honey  
* 45 ml fish sauce  
* 2 tsp cornstarch, made into a slurry

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 200C. Roast the pork belly in the oven until well done, about 1 hr. Once pork belly is cooked, remove from the oven and allow to rest for 20 minutes  
2. Slice the pork into bite-sized pieces, and add to a frying pan along with the spices, the honey, the fish sauce, and 30 ml of water. Bring to a boil and cook for a few minutes.  
3. Add the cornstarch slurry and stir for a couple minutes, until thicken. Remove from heat, and serve the meat coated in sauce

**Notes**

* The original recipe doesn’t specify which spices to use, just that a “spice mix” (*condimentum*) is needed. I’ve used cumin, coriander, mustard seed, and fennel, following a spice mixture discovered by archaeologists in London.  
* Serving *ofellae* with *liquamen* and honey appears to be a common alternative to *oenogarum*. Both Vinidarius 3 and 5 are also for *ofellae* in *liquamen* and honey, but omit the spices.

### Pork Ribs {#pork-ribs}

Apicius 7.4.4

**Ingredients**

* 1.2 kg rack of pork ribs  
* 50 ml fish sauce  
* 50 ml red wine vinegar  
* 50 ml olive oil

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 325 F. Place the pork ribs into a roast tray and cook for 1h 20m, or until cooked through. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly, then cut into individual ribs.  
2. Place the rib into a wok or large fry pan, and add the fish sauce, red wine, olive oil, and 50 ml of water. Turn the heat to high and fry vigorously for 5 minutes, or until the liquid has almost entirely evaporated. Serve the ribs with a little of the cooking liquid.

### Spiced *Ofellae* {#spiced-ofellae}

*Ofellas garaton* \- Vinidarius 6

1. Preheat the oven to 200C. Place the pork onto a baking tray, place in the oven, and bake for 40 minutes.  
2. Place the pork into a small dutch oven along with the fish sauce, spices, and 300 ml of water. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 30 minutes or until the pork is falling off the bone. Remove the spare ribs from the cooking broth and serve.

## **Pork** {#pork}

### Boiled Pork in Cold Apician Sauce {#boiled-pork-in-cold-apician-sauce}

Apicius 8.7.6

**Ingredients**

* 1 kg meat from pork shoulder  
* Pepper  
* 2 tsp lovage  
* 2 tsp rue  
* 3 tsp mint  
* 3 tsp coriander seed  
* 200 ml white wine  
* 50 ml fish sauce  
* 3 Tb honey

**Method**

1. Boil the pork in salted water for about 1.5 hrs, until cooked through  
2. Once the pork is cooked, prepare the sauce by mixing together all of the remaining ingredients.  
3. Remove the cooked pork from the water and wipe dry with a paper towel. Dice or shred the meat in a serving dish, pour on the cold sauce, and serve.

**Notes**

* This is one of the few recipes attributed to Apicius within Apicius. Another, 6.7, calls for an almost identical cold sauce for boiled goose  
* The recipe is originally for a whole piglet which had not yet been weaned.  
* If you like, you can boil barley with the pork as a side dish. Boiling barley with meat or broth was a common classical practice. If doing so, instead of salt you can add a bit of fish sauce to the cooking liquid, along with peppercorns and bay leaves for flavour.

2. Add all of the remaining ingredients, barring only the starch and half the celery seed, to a saucepan. Bring to the boil then simmer for 5 minutes.  
3. Add the cornstarch slurry and continue to cook until thickened. Place the meat on a serving dish and pour the sauce over, then sprinkle on the remaining celery seed and serve.

**Notes**

* To make *Apicius* 8.7.7, Vitellian piglet, simply omit the caraway, celery seed, asafoetida, and rue.  
* To make *Apicius* 8.7.9, piglet in bay sauce, slice the pork horizontally almost in half and place a few bay leaves in the cavity. Then prepare the above sauce, simply replacing the rue with a pounded bay berry.

### Cold Sauce for Boiled Pork {#cold-sauce-for-boiled-pork}

Apicius 8.7.15

**Ingredients**

* 1 Tb caraway seeds  
* 120g pine nuts  
* 30g mustard seeds  
* Pepper  
* 2 tsp dill leaf  
* 1 tsp oregano  
* 4 Tb vinegar  
* 3 Tb date syrup  
* 2 Tb fish sauce   
* 1 Tb honey  
* 1 Tb olive oil

**Method**

1. Grind the caraway seeds, pine nuts, and mustard seeds into a fine paste in a mortar and pestle, or food processor  
2. Combine with the rest of the ingredients, and serve.

**Notes**

* This should be enough sauce for 500g of boiled pork \- use the previous recipe if you like. The original recipe is, like the previous one, for boiled piglet  
* I have based my modern version on Sally Granger’s rendition, see Cooking *Apicius* pg 75  
* The original recipe in Apicius calls for “made-up mustard”, probably a mustard-vinegar condiment akin to modern mustard. You should therefore feel free to use yellow mustard, but reduce the vinegar accordingly

### Lamb with *Hyposphagma* {#lamb-with-hyposphagma}

Athenaeus 516c, quoting Erasistratus

Hyposphagma *for roast meat: the blood to be blended with honey, cheese, salt, cumin, silphium—these heated together.*

**Ingredients**

* 1.5 kg boneless leg of lamb  
* 400 ml pig’s blood  
* 100 g fresh goat cheese  
* 3 Tb honey  
* 1½ tsp cumin  
* A pinch of asafoetida  
* 1½ tsp salt 

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. Roast the leg of lamb for about 90 minutes, or until cooked to the desired doneness. Once cooked, remove from the oven, cover in aluminium foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.  
2. While the lamb is resting, prepare the sauce by adding the remaining ingredients into a saucepan and whisking them together until thoroughly combined.   
3. Place the saucepan on the stove and bring to just below a simmer, whisking constantly to prevent the blood from congealing. Taste and adjust the flavors as desired, and then continue gently cooking for a few minutes as the sauce thickens.  
4. Once the sauce has thickened and the lamb rested, carve the lamb and serve with some of the sauce poured over.
