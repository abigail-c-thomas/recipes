## ***Ofellae*** {#ofellae}

*Ofellae* is a Latin word referring to marinated bite-sized pieces of meat that have been cooked in a richly-flavoured sauce. We have ten surviving recipes for *ofellae*—six from Apicius, Book 7, and a further four from Vinidarius. While some of the recipes are vague, they seem to involve a two-step cooking process. The meat is first slowly roasted or boiled, and then afterwards quickly "fried" in a flavorful sauce. The final dish should be succulent and tender, somewhat similar to modern BBQ or braised dishes; one of Martial's epigrams mentions *ofellae* so tender that they do not need a carver to slice the meat.

*Ofellae* were a staple of taverns, and the Emperor Claudius even rhetorically asked "Who can life without *offulae*?" in a Senate discussion on cookshops. Given the two-step nature of the cooking process, my guess is that in these taverns the slow cooked meat would have been prepared ahead of time, and when *offellae* was ordered the simple reheated in the sauce. This method also works well with these recipes below.

### Ostian *Ofellae* {#ostian-ofellae}

Apicius 7.4.1

**Ingredients**  
*For marinade:*

* 1 kg pork belly  
* 1½ tsp ground black pepper   
* ½ tsp lovage leaf  
* 3 tsp dill seed  
* 3 tsp cumin seed   
* ½ tsp asafoetida  
* 2 bay berries  
* 45 ml fish sauce

*For sauce:*

* 150 ml *passum*  
* 30 ml fish sauce  
* ½ tsp lovage  
* Generous ground black pepper  
* 1 Tb cornstarch, made into slurry

**Method**

1. Dry roast and grind the seeds in the marinade, then combine with the lovage, asafoetida, and fish sauce  
2. Place the meat skin side down. Score the meat by cutting through the meat down to, but not through, the skin, in parallel lines 3 cm apart. Then cut meat orthogonally, again not cutting through the skin, to get a grid of 3cm x 3cm squares. Cover the meat with the marinade and place covered in the fridge for 3 days.  
3. Once the meat has marinated and you are ready to cook it, preheat the oven to 190C / 375F. Rub a little olive oil over the meat, and place on a roasting tray. Roast for 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until the meat is well-done and can be easily pulled from the skin. Once cooked, take out to rest while you prepare the sauce  
4. Place the *passum*, fish sauce, lovage, and pepper in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Simmer for a few minutes, then add the cornstarch slurry to thicken.  
5. Cut the meat into pieces, and serve with the sauce.

### Apician *Ofellae* {#apician-ofellae}

Apicius 7.4.2

**Ingredients**

* 750 g pork belly  
* 150 ml *passum*  
* 45 ml fish sauce  
* 1 Tb olive oil  
* 8 tiger nuts, crushed  
* 2 tsp cumin  
* ½ tsp lovage  
* Ground pepper

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 200C. Roast the pork belly in the oven until well done, about 1 hr. Once pork belly is cooked, remove from the oven and slice into 3cm x 3cm chunks  
2. Place the pork along with the remaining ingredients into a saucepan. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking until the sauce has mostly evaporated, and clings to the meat. Remove the meat from the saucepan, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

**Notes**

* Tiger nuts don't have any close substitutes. Almonds are probably the closest substitute — I would suggest using a 2 tsp almond meal. Sally Grainger suggests 1 tsp ground ginger, which results in a pleasant taste but to my palate one that is fairly different from using tiger nuts.  
* This recipe appears to be a fairly "typical" form of *ofellae*: the meat is first roasted or boiled, then separate "fried" and served in an *oenogarum*. Apicius 7.4.5 and and Vinidarius 4 give generic instructions of this form, but ingredients for the *oenogarum* are not specified. One could simply omit the tiger nuts (and, optionally, cumin) to recreate these more "generic" *ofellae* recipes. 

### Wild-Boar Style *Ofellae* {#wild-boar-style-ofellae}

Apicius 7.4.3

**Ingredients**

* 750 g pork belly  
* 2 tsp ground cumin  
* 2 tsp ground coriander  
* 1 tsp ground mustard seed  
* ½ tsp ground fennel seed  
* ½ tsp ground pepper  
* 90 g honey  
* 45 ml fish sauce  
* 2 tsp cornstarch, made into a slurry

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 200C. Roast the pork belly in the oven until well done, about 1 hr. Once pork belly is cooked, remove from the oven and allow to rest for 20 minutes  
2. Slice the pork into bite-sized pieces, and add to a frying pan along with the spices, the honey, the fish sauce, and 30 ml of water. Bring to a boil and cook for a few minutes.  
3. Add the cornstarch slurry and stir for a couple minutes, until thicken. Remove from heat, and serve the meat coated in sauce

**Notes**

* The original recipe doesn't specify which spices to use, just that a "spice mix" (*condimentum*) is needed. I've used cumin, coriander, mustard seed, and fennel, following a spice mixture discovered by archaeologists in London.  
* Serving *ofellae* with *liquamen* and honey appears to be a common alternative to *oenogarum*. Both Vinidarius 3 and 5 are also for *ofellae* in *liquamen* and honey, but omit the spices.

### Pork Ribs {#pork-ribs}

Apicius 7.4.4

**Ingredients**

* 1.2 kg rack of pork ribs  
* 50 ml fish sauce  
* 50 ml red wine vinegar  
* 50 ml olive oil

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 325 F. Place the pork ribs into a roast tray and cook for 1h 20m, or until cooked through. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly, then cut into individual ribs.  
2. Place the rib into a wok or large fry pan, and add the fish sauce, red wine, olive oil, and 50 ml of water. Turn the heat to high and fry vigorously for 5 minutes, or until the liquid has almost entirely evaporated. Serve the ribs with a little of the cooking liquid.

### Spiced *Ofellae* {#spiced-ofellae}

*Ofellas garaton* \- Vinidarius 6

**Ingredients**

* 700g bone-in pork spare ribs, chopped into bite-sized pieces  
* 60 ml fish sauce  
* 1 tsp ground ginger  
* ¾ tsp ground cardamom  
* ½ tsp asafoetida

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 200C. Place the pork onto a baking tray, place in the oven, and bake for 40 minutes.  
2. Place the pork into a small dutch oven along with the fish sauce, spices, and 300 ml of water. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 30 minutes or until the pork is falling off the bone. Remove the spare ribs from the cooking broth and serve.

## **Pork** {#pork}

### Boiled Pork in Cold Apician Sauce {#boiled-pork-in-cold-apician-sauce}

Apicius 8.7.6

**Ingredients**

* 1 kg meat from pork shoulder  
* Pepper  
* 2 tsp lovage  
* 2 tsp rue  
* 3 tsp mint  
* 3 tsp coriander seed  
* 200 ml white wine  
* 50 ml fish sauce  
* 3 Tb honey

**Method**

1. Boil the pork in salted water for about 1.5 hrs, until cooked through  
2. Once the pork is cooked, prepare the sauce by mixing together all of the remaining ingredients.  
3. Remove the cooked pork from the water and wipe dry with a paper towel. Dice or shred the meat in a serving dish, pour on the cold sauce, and serve.

**Notes**

* This is one of the few recipes attributed to Apicius within Apicius. Another, 6.7, calls for an almost identical cold sauce for boiled goose  
* The recipe is originally for a whole piglet which had not yet been weaned.  
* If you like, you can boil barley with the pork as a side dish. Boiling barley with meat or broth was a common classical practice. If doing so, instead of salt you can add a bit of fish sauce to the cooking liquid, along with peppercorns and bay leaves for flavour.

### Flaccian Piglet {#flaccian-piglet}

Apicius 8.7.8

**Ingredients**

* 1 kg meat from pork shoulder  
* ½ tsp pepper  
* ½ tsp lovage  
* ½ tsp caraway seed, ground  
* ½ tsp celery seed, ground  
* 1 tsp asafoetida  
* 1 tsp rue  
* 40 ml fish sauce  
* 100 ml wine  
* 100 ml *passum*  
* 2 Tb olive oil  
* 1 Tb cornstarch, made into a slurry

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 325 F / 160 C. Generously salt the meat and then roast for 1.5 hours, or until cooked through. Take out to rest while you prepare the sauce.  
2. Add all of the remaining ingredients, barring only the starch and half the celery seed, to a saucepan. Bring to the boil then simmer for 5 minutes.  
3. Add the cornstarch slurry and continue to cook until thickened. Place the meat on a serving dish and pour the sauce over, then sprinkle on the remaining celery seed and serve.

**Notes**

* To make *Apicius* 8.7.7, Vitellian piglet, simply omit the caraway, celery seed, asafoetida, and rue.  
* To make *Apicius* 8.7.9, piglet in bay sauce, slice the pork horizontally almost in half and place a few bay leaves in the cavity. Then prepare the above sauce, simply replacing the rue with a pounded bay berry.

### Frontonian Piglet {#frontonian-piglet}

Apicius 8.7.11

**Ingredients**

* 1 kg pork shoulder roast  
* 300 ml white wine  
* 50 ml fish sauce

* 2 tsp dill  
* 3 Tb *defrutum*  
* Ground black pepper  
* Olive oil

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F / 160 C.   
2. Heat a little olive oil in a large dutch oven, and brown the pork shoulder on all sides.  
3. Clean the leak and make sure to remove any dirt between the leaves. Add to the dutch oven along with wine, fish sauce, *defrutum,* and dill. Place the lid on the dutch oven, then place in the oven and cook for 1.5 hours or until the meat is cooked through.  
4. Remove the meat from the dutch oven, dry it, and place on a dish. Sprinkle it with pepper and serve.

### Cold Sauce for Boiled Pork {#cold-sauce-for-boiled-pork}

Apicius 8.7.15

* 1 Tb olive oil

**Method**

1. Grind the caraway seeds, pine nuts, and mustard seeds into a fine paste in a mortar and pestle, or food processor  
2. Combine with the rest of the ingredients, and serve.

**Notes**

* This should be enough sauce for 500g of boiled pork \- use the previous recipe if you like. The original recipe is, like the previous one, for boiled piglet  
* I have based my modern version on Sally Granger's rendition, see Cooking *Apicius* pg 75  
* The original recipe in Apicius calls for "made-up mustard", probably a mustard-vinegar condiment akin to modern mustard. You should therefore feel free to use yellow mustard, but reduce the vinegar accordingly

### Pork Loin {#pork-loin}

## **Salted Meat** {#salted-meat}

### Ham Shoulder in Pastry {#ham-shoulder-in-pastry}

Apicius 7.9.1

**Ingredients**

* 1.5 kg ham shoulder  
* 10 dried figs  
* 3 bay leaves  
* 200 g white flour  
* 2 Tb olive oil  
* ¼ tsp salt  
* 100 ml water  
* 100 g set honey

**Method**

1. Boil the ham shoulder with the figs and the bay leaves for about 1.5 hours, or until cooked. Remove the ham shoulder from the water and allow it to cool.  
2. Prepare the pastry by mixing together the flour, salt, and oil, then combining with water to form a dough. Need until smooth and pliable.  
3. Remove the skin of the ham (if present) and score meat in a grid fashion. Pour of the honey. Next roll out the pastry into a thin sheet with a rolling pin. Place the ham in the center and wrap so that it is entirely enclosed, sealing the edges.  
4. Place the ham in a preheated oven at 190 C/375 F and bake for 50 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp. Remove from the oven and serve.

**Notes**

* I still need to get this recipe right, as the honey leaks out. Probably should up the olive oil (the recipe doesn't say to use water, but that might just be an omission), maybe also make a bit more pastry  
* The liquor the ham is cooked in can be used to boil barley, which goes well with the meal  
* Ham wrapped in pastry was part of the luxurious dish *tetrapharmakum*, allegedly invented by junior emperor Aelius Verus (d. 138\) and enjoyed by both Hadrian and Alexander Septimus. This information is from the notorious *Historia Augusta*, where it is credited to Marius Maximus's biography of Hadrian.  
* Modern versions of this recipe exist, such as ham en croute. Not sure the subsequent history but plausibly this has survived through time

### Salted Shoulder of Pork {#salted-shoulder-of-pork}

Apicius 7.9.3

**Ingredients**

* 700 g gammon or smoked ham  
* 250 g pearl barley  
* 10 dried figs  
* 100 g honey  
* 250 ml white wine  
* 250 ml *passum*  
* 2 tsp dried rue  
* ½ tsp black pepper  
* 30 ml *liquamen*  
* 6 *mustacei* (must cakes, see recipe)

**Method**

1. Place the meat in a large saucepan with the barley and figs. Add water to cover. Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 hour.  
2. Preheat the oven to 400F/200C. Remove the meat from the saucepan, and place on a baking tray, and allow to cool for a few minutes. Then cover with the honey and place in the oven for 30 minutes.  
3. While the meat is in the oven, prepare the sauce by combining the white wine, *passum*, rue, pepper, and *liquamen* in a bowl. Mix together and adjust as desired.  
4. Once the pork is cooked, carve and plate with the mustacei broken in half, then pour over the sauce. Serve along with the barley and figs.

**Notes**

* Recipe 7.9.2 is similar and suggests using plain bread (though must cakes are apparently better). Rather then specify the sauce it sauces to use *caroenum* or spice wine.

### Lard {#lard}

Apicius 7.9.4

**Ingredients**

*  200 g lardo or salted pork fat  
* 1 tsp dried dill  
* Salt

* 2 Tb honey  
* 1 Tb oil  
* Ground pepper

**Method**

1. Place the meat in a saucepan along with 50 ml of fish sauce and half of the brown onion. Add enough water to cover the meat, then simmer with the lid on for 2 hours, or until the meat is cooked and falling apart. Check periodically to make sure enough water remains, and add more if needed.  
2. Once the meat is cooked, take 100 ml of the cooking liquid and pour onto the bread to soak for a few minutes.   
3. Add the bread, the remaining 40 ml of fish sauce and half an onion, along with the pine nuts, rue, honey, oil, and a generous helping of ground pepper to a food processor. Process until smooth.  
4. Pour the sauce into a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, or until the onion flavour mellows. Adjust with fish sauce or honey as desired.   
5. Carve the meat, and serve smothered in the sauce.

**Notes**

* You can add vegetables like carrots or parsnips to the meat as it cooks, and serve as side dishes  
* Any leftover cooking liquid can be used as stock for other recipes - for instance, to cook barley or lentils. If you like, you can add herbs (such as parsley, coriander, or bay leaf) while cooking the meat to further enhance the flavour of the stock.

**Notes**

* This recipe is for hare but hare is impossible to find here, so I've substituted rabbit

* 1 tsp mustard seed  
* A pinch of asafoetida  
* 2 tsp dried mint  
* 3 Tb fish sauce

3. Place the chicken thighs in a roasting tin. Pour the sauce over the chicken so that it is completely covered on all sides.  
4. Place the chicken in the oven for about 45 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Baste the chicken with the sauce every 10 minutes or so. Once cooked, serve sprinkled with pepper.

**Notes**

* This is, with minor adjustments, the recipe suggested on pg 67-8 of Sally Grainger's *Cooking Apicius*

### Parthian Chicken {#parthian-chicken}

Apicius 6.8.3  
**Ingredients**

*Pullum anetatum* \- Apicius 6.8.1-2
* 200 ml white wine  
* 30 ml fish sauce  
* 1 tsp lovage  
* 1 tsp caraway seed  
* ½ tsp asafoetida  
* Black pepper

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C / 350 F.  
2. Dry-fry the caraway seeds, then grind in a mortar and pestle. Combine in a measuring jug with wine, fish sauce, lovage, and asafoetida, along with a generous amount of ground black pepper.  
3. Place the chicken in a casserole dish, skin side up. Pour the sauce over the chicken, then place in the oven uncovered and bake for 50 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.  
4. Once the chicken is cooked, remove from the oven, sprinkle with extra black pepper, and serve.

**Notes**

* This dish is named after Parthia. This could be because it is stylistically similar to a Parthian dish, though lovage and caraway both are distinctly Roman ingredients this seems unlikely. Instead the dish may be named because of its prominent use of *asafoetida*, known in Latin as Parthian *laser* to distinguish from *silphium*, which was called Cyrenaican *laser*.  
* Apicius 6.8.6, for chicken in a *laser* sauce, is very similar, merely lacking the caraway seeds. So if you don't like / don't have caraway seeds, you can make this recipe authentically without them. 

### Chicken in Sour Sauce {#chicken-in-sour-sauce}

Apicius 6.8.4

**Ingredients**

* 4 chicken thighs  
* 1 small leak, thoroughly washed  
* A couple sprigs of parsley  
* 1 ½ tsp black pepper  
* 50 ml olive oil  
* 40 ml fish sauce  
* 40 ml white wine  
* 30 ml white wine vinegar

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C / 350 F.  
2. Place the chicken in a dutch oven, skin side up, along with the leak. Add the remaining ingredients to the dutch oven, place in the oven, and cook for 50 minutes.  
3. Discard the leak and the parsley. Plate the chicken, drizzled with some of the sauce, and serve.

### Numidian Chicken {#numidian-chicken}

Apicius 6.8.5

**Ingredients**

* 4 chicken thighs, with skin and bone  
* 2x ½ tsp of asafoetida, separated  
* 30 g pine nuts  
* 4 dates   
* Pepper  
* 2 tsp cumin  
* 2 tsp coriander seed  
* 1 tsp rue  
* 2 Tb vinegar  
* 2 Tb honey  
* 3 Tb liquamen  
* 2 Tb oil  
* 1.5 Tb cornstarch, made into a slurry

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F  
2. Rub a ½ tsp of asafoetida onto the chicken thighs, then sprinkle ground pepper over. Place in a roasting tray and roast for 45 minutes, or until cooked through and the skin is golden  
3. Place the dates in a bowl with a little water and microwave for 1 minute to soften. Place in a food processor with the pine nuts and blend into a paste.  
4. Add the pine nut/date paste to a saucepan along with the remaining ingredients (excluding the cornstarch slurry). Add a generous amount of ground pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for a couple minutes. Taste and adjust as desired - you may wish to add a couple tablespoons of water to reduce the intensity of the sauce.  
5. Add the cornstarch slurry, a little at a time, while the saucepan is over the heat, until a thick consistency is reached.    
6. Plate the chicken thighs and then cover in the sauce. Sprinkle on some additional black pepper.

**Notes**

* This dish might be named after Numidia, a region in North Africa. It is also possible it is named after the guinea fowl, usually *meleagris* but also known as the *gallina Numidica* - the modern scientific name is *Numida meleagris*. Indeed, the term *pullum* used throughout Section 6.8 means "chicken" but can also be used for fowl more broadly, and guinea fowl could be used as an authentic substitute for chicken in any of them

### Vardanian Chicken {#vardanian-chicken}

Apicius 6.8.11

**Ingredients**

* 6 chicken thighs  
* 1 leek  
* 1 bundle of coriander leaves  
* 1 tsp savoury  
* 400 ml wine  
* 60 ml fish sauce  
* 2 Tb olive oil  
* Pepper  
* 100 g pine nuts, ground  
* 250 ml milk  
* 3 egg whites

**Method**

1. Place the chicken thighs in a dutch oven along with the wine, fish sauce, olive oil, and savoury. Wash leek and coriander leaves, then place them on top without chopping. Bring to a simmer, then cook with the lid on for 25 minutes  
2. Remove the leek and coriander leaves from the pot, then add the pine nuts, milk, and a generous amount of pepper. Beat the egg whites with a fork, then pour them over, making sure to stir so that they don't immediately curdle. Gently heat until the sauce thickens and begins to break, then serve.

### Frontonian Chicken {#frontonian-chicken}

Apicius 6.8.12

**Ingredients**

* 1 kg chicken thighs, with skin and bone  
* 2 Tb olive oil  
* 2 Tb fish sauce  
* 1 leek, sliced in half  
* 1 tsp dill leaf  
* ½ tsp dried savoury  
* 1 small handful coriander leaf  
* 120 ml *defrutum*  
* Pepper

**Method**

1. Place a large dutch oven on high heat. Place the chicken skin side down, and fry until the skin is golden. Flip and brown on the meat side.  
2. Add the olive oil, fish sauce, leek, and herbs, along with 100 ml of water. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.  
3. Remove the chicken from the cooking liquor. Plate each thigh with just a little of the cooking liquor. Drizzle on a tablespoon or so of *defrutum*, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

**Notes**

* The broth and leek are not eaten, probably because they look unappetizing, but they taste really good  
* The Fronto referred to is likely the same author who wrote sections 7.12, 7.22, and 19.2 of *The Geoponica*. Plausibly this "Fronto" is Sextus Julius Frontinus (c. 40 – 103), a Roman senator and consul known chiefly now for having written a treatise on aqueduct.

### Chicken *Tractogalatus* {#chicken-tractogalatus}

*Pullus Tractogalatus* \- Apicius 6.8.13

**Ingredients**

* 4 chicken thighs, with skin and bone  
* 300 ml white wine  
* 60 ml fish sauce  
* 1 onion, peeled and slice in half  
* 1 small handful of coriander leaves  
* 2 Tb olive olive  
* 400 ml of milk  
* 4 heaped Tb semolina  
* 2 Tb \+ 2 Tb honey  
* Pepper  
* ½ tsp dried lovage  
* 1 tsp dried oregano  
* 2 Tb *defrutum*  
* 2 Tb cornstarch, mixed with water into a slurry

**Method**

1. Add the white wine, fish sauce, onion, coriander leaves, and olive oil to a large saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the chicken thighs and simmer for about 25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.  
2. Add the milk, semolina, and 2 Tb honey to a separate saucepan, along with a couple pinches of salt. Heat and stir until it becomes very thick, being careful not to let it burn.  
3. Once the chicken is cooked, remove from the cooking liquor. Cover in the semolina mixture and place onto a serving dish. Add the rest of the semolina around the chicken.  
4. Prepare the sauce by adding the lovage, oregano, generous ground pepper, *defrutum*, final 2 Tb honey, and 200 ml of the chicken cooking liquor to another saucepan. Bring to a boil, then add the cornstarch slurry to thicken.  
5. Pour the thickened sauce over the chicken and semolina, then serve.

**Notes**

* *Tractogalatus* means milk with *tracta*, an uncooked dough often used to thicken Roman sauces. I have used semolina as a substitute.  
* The final presentation of this dish is a little unclear to me. It seems that the milk/semolina mixture is supposed to adhere to the chicken in one solid mass. Perhaps the chicken and semolina mixture could be put into an oven at a low temperature for a few minutes while the sauce cooks?  
* Alternative, for modern sensibilities it might be better to serve the chicken on the semolina with the sauce on the side.

2. Rotate the duck, then bake for another 20 minutes. Baste with *defrutum*, then bake for another 10 minutes. Baste once more, then roast another 5–10 minutes or until cooked. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before carving.  
3. While the duck roasts, coarsely chop the onions, then place in a saucepan along with the remaining sauce ingredients. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, then take off the heat and allow to cool.  
4. Place the sauce into a food processor and blend until smooth. Pour back into the saucepan and bring gently back to heat. Serve the duck with the sauce. 

**Notes**

* I didn't get the duck skin crispy with the above method and tbh wasn't that impressed, maybe should try [this method](https://mapleleaffarms.com/recipes/roasted-whole-duck-basic-recipe-for-crispy-skin) next?  
* Also had difficulty getting the duck defrosted, it needs at least 2 days in the fridge

**Duck with Turnips**  
*Apicius 6.8.3*

*Wash and prepare the crane or duck. Boil it in a pot with water, salt, and dill until half-cooked. Separately, cook the turnips until their bitterness is removed. Remove the bird from the pot, wash it again, and place it in a pan with oil, fish sauce, and a bundle of leek and coriander. Add the washed and finely chopped turnips on top, ensuring everything cooks together. Toward the end of cooking, add a small amount of* defrutum *to color the dish. Prepare a sauce by grinding pepper, cumin, coriander, and* laser *root. Moisten with vinegar and the cooking broth, then pour it over the duck in the pot and let it boil. Thicken with starch, pour the sauce over the turnips, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.*

**Ingredients**

* 1 whole duck (about 2 kg)  
* 600 g turnips, peeled and diced  
* 2 tsp salt  
* 2 tsp dried dill  
* 3 tbsp olive oil

* 3 tsp coriander seed, ground  
* ½ tsp asafoetida  
* 2 tbsp red wine vinegar  
* 1½  Tb cornstarch mixed with water into a slurry

**Method**

1. Remove the wings and neck from the duck and trim any excess skin and fat. Place the duck in a large dutch oven along with the trimmings and giblets (if included). Add the salt and dill along with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 45 minutes, until the duck is half-cooked  
2. Place the diced turnips in a separate pot. Bring to a boil, then immediately remove from the heat, pour out the hot water, and shock with cold water.  
3. Remove the duck from the pot and reserve the stock for later. Clean out the dutch oven and then place the duck back inside.  
4. Add the olive oil, fish sauce, leak, and coriander to the dutch oven, then add the cooked turnips on top. Cover and simmer on low heat for about 45 minutes, or until everything is cooked. Drizzle the *defrutum* over the duck mid-way through the cooking.  
5. While the duck is cooking, combine the ground pepper, cumin, coriander seed, and asafoetida with the vinegar. Add 400 ml of the reserved stock, first skimming off the fat  
6. Once the duck is cooked, remove and discard the leek and coriander. Pour over the sauce, then bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust the sauce as needed, then add the cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce.  
7. Remove the duck, turnips, and sauce to a serving platter. Carve the duck and serve with the turnip and sauce.

3. Combine the wine, fish sauce, oil, vinegar, honey, and herbs into a mixing jug and stir to combine. Pour three quarters of the liquid over the duck.  
4. Mix the remaining liquid with the hazelnut. Pat down the hazelnut mixture onto the exposed skin of the duck to form a coat. (Any remaining hazelnut mixture should be added to the oven dish, where it will float.)  
5. Roast the duck at 180℃ for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve with a little of the cooking liquid.

### Duck with Turnips {#duck-with-turnips}

Modified from *A Taste of Ancient Rome*, page 110\.  (Also should add dill?)

**Ingredients**

* 4 duck leg and thighs  
* 1 Tb olive oil  
* 1 Tb garum  
* 1 small leek, sliced  
* 700g of turnips  
* 120 ml of wine  
* 2 tsp cumin  
* 2 tsp coriander seed  
* 1 tsp asafoetida  
* 1 Tb vinegar  
* 1 tsp cornstarch, mixed with water into a slurry

**Method**

1. Begin by boiling all but one of the turnips in a large amount of water. This should take around 25 minutes. Once they are cooked, they can be sliced.  
2. While the turnips are boiling, brown the duck, skin side down, in a dutch oven. Once golden, flip and add the leek and garum, and fry until browned.  
3. Slice one turnip and add to the duck. Then add the wine, and simmer covered for about 15 minutes, or until the duck is cooked through.  
4. Add the spices and the vinegar to the duck. Thicken, as desired, with the cornstarch. Then add the sliced boiled turnips to the duck, and serve.

*Note:* The turnips are boiled separately from the duck to remove their bitter flavour. If the turnips are substituted for other root vegetables, such as parsnip or carrot, the vegetables can be boiled together with the duck.

# **Seafood** {#seafood}

## **Apician Sauces for Fish** {#apician-sauces-for-fish}

Between *Apicius* Books 9 and 10 and *Vinidarius* there are about 45 distinct recipes for specific fish sauces. 

**Recipes recreated:** *Apicius* 10.1.1, 10.1.2, 10.2.4/10.3.1

### Herb Sauce for Fried Fish {#herb-sauce-for-fried-fish}

Apicius 10.1.1

* ½ tsp ground black pepper  
* ½ tsp cumin  
* ½ tsp coriander seed  
* ½ tsp asafoetida  
* ½ tsp dried oregano  
* ½ tsp dried rue  
* 4 dates, minced (or 2 Tb date syrup)  
* 1 Tb olive oil (additional for frying)  
* 2 Tb honey  
* 2 Tb *defrutum*  
* 3 Tb red wine vinegar  
* 1½ Tb *liquamen* 

**Method**

1. Add all of the ingredients (other than the fish) to a small saucepan, mix together, and gently bring to a simmer for a few minutes. Taste and adjust as needed, then turn down the heat to keep warm while the fish is being fried.   
2. Heat a little olive oil in a skillet, then fry the fish until cooked.   
3. Plate the fish with the sauce drizzled over it, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

**Notes**

* Vinidarius 8 is very similar, and both texts clearly share a common origin. The sauce is slightly different in that it omits cumin and honey  
* Interesting the dates in Apicius 10.1.1 appear with the liquids and perhaps refers to date syrup, while those in Vinidarius 8 are explicitly pounded  
* Both recipes say that they can be used on any fish

4. Once the sardines are cooked, gut them and add them to the frying pan and bring back to a simmer. Add the cornstarch slurry, allow to thicken for a minute, and serve.

### Lucretian Patella {#lucretian-patella}

Apicius 4.2.25

**Ingredients**

* 320 g salted fish  
* 1 large white onion, finely diced  
* 1 tsp fish sauce  
* 2 Tb olive oil  
* 1 Tb honey  
* 2 tsp *defrutum*  
* 2 tsp vinegar  
* 1 tsp dried savoury

**Method**

1. Rinse the salt from the fish. Place in a large bowl, cover with water, and leave to soak in the fridge for at least a few hours, changing the water several times.  
2. When ready to cook, place the onions in a frying pan along with the fish sauce, olive oil, and 2 Tb of water. Cook for about 5 minutes or until the onions are translucent.  
3. Drain the salted fish and place in the frying pan, and cook until the fish is almost done.  
4. Add the remaining ingredients to the frying pan. Mix everything together for a few minutes, then taste and adjust seasonings if needed. Remove from the heat and serve.

**Notes**

* I haven't yet worked out how long to soak salt fish, my first attempt was too salty  
* Apicius 4.2.24 gives a similar recipe for salt fish

### Tuna Salad {#tuna-salad}

Apicius 9.10.2

**Ingredients**

* 200g canned tuna  
* Ground black pepper  
* ½ tsp dried lovage  
* ½ tsp dried thyme  
* ½ tsp dried rue  
* 2 tsp date syrup  
* 2 tsp honey  
* 1 boiled egg  
* 1 tsp wine  
* 1 tsp vinegar  
* 1 tsp *defrutum*  
* 2 Tb olive oil

**Method**  
Mix the tuna with the herbs, date syrup, and honey. Add ground pepper and salt to taste. Place into a small serving dish. Slice the boiled egg and place on top to decorate. Mix the wine, vinegar, *defrutum*, and olive oil together and use to dress the tuna.

**Notes**

* This recipe is originally for bonito, but that is hard to find.  
* This recipe, and indeed all the bonito recipes, have no fish sauce or salt of any kind. My guess is that the bonito was salted, and definitely the recipe tastes better with salt.

### Poached Fish {#poached-fish}

Apicius 10.1.5

**Ingredients**

* 400 g white fish fillet  
* ½ tsp ground black pepper  
* 1 tsp coriander seed  
* ½ tsp dried dill leaf  
* 30 ml fish sauce  
* 400 ml water  
* Red vinegar

**Method**

1. Choose a frying pan just large enough to fit the pieces of fish. Add the spices, fish sauce, and water to the pan, and bring to a simmer.  
2. Add the fish, then reduce the heat so that the water remains below a simmer. Poach the fish until cooked, about 5–10 minutes.  
3. Remove the fish from the poaching liquid and serve sprinkled with a little vinegar and pepper.

### Baked Horse-Mackerel {#baked-horse-mackerel}

Athenaeus 322c-d, quoting a lost play by Alexis

**Ingredients**

* A 500g horse-mackerel (or any white fish fillet)  
* 125g chevre cheese (or feta, or other strongly flavoured cheese)  
* ½ tsp of asafoetida  
* 1 tsp dried oregano, or leaves from two fresh sprigs

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F.  
2. If using a whole mackerel, split open the fish down the belly and open it out. Remove the spine and as many bones as you can, then place flesh side up onto a baking tray. (If using fish fillets, simply place on a baking tray with skin, if present touching the tray.)  
3. Evenly sprinkle salt and asafoetida over the fish. Next, crumble over the cheese, then finally sprinkle over the oregano.  
4. Place in the oven to bake for 20 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. Then turn on the broiler and broil until the cheese is golden brown. 

### Fish with White-Sauce {#fish-with-white-sauce}

Galen *On the Power of Foods* R18

**Ingredients**

* 450g salmon fillets  
* 1 leek, finely chopped  
* 1 tsp dried dill leaf  
* 1 Tb olive oil, plus more for serving  
* Salt

**Method**

1. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan. Add the leeks and gently fry for a few minutes.  
2. Add the salmon, along with 150ml of water, the dill leaf, and a few pinches of salt. Simmer until the salmon is cooked and the sauce has reduced somewhat. Drizzle on some more olive oil, if desired, and serve.

**Notes**

* Galen doesn't specify which fish to use, but it is in the section for fish with "soft flesh". I think it works well with salmon, a river fish from northern Europe rarely mentioned by Greek writers but praised by Latin ones. Both Cassiodorus and Anthimus recommended it to German kings in the 6th century.

### Fried calamari {#fried-calamari}

Apicius 9.3.1

**Ingredients**

* 300 g calamari, cut into rings  
* 1 Tb olive oil  
* ½ tsp dried rue  
* 1 tsp honey  
* 1 Tb fish sauce  
* 1 Tb *defrutum*  
* Generous ground black pepper

**Method**

1. Thoroughly dry the calamari with a paper towel  
2. Place the olive oil in a frying pan and place on high heat. When the pan is very hot, add the calamari and fry for a couple minutes, until the calamari is opaque and beginning to curl.  
3. Add in the remaining ingredients. Toss everything together for a minute, take off the heat, and serve.

### Prawns in cumin sauce {#prawns-in-cumin-sauce}

* 1 Tb fish sauce  
* 1 Tb vinegar  
* 1 tejpat leaf (optional)

**Method**

1. Boil the prawns to cook them  
2. While the prawns are cooking, combine the remaining ingredients in a small pan, crushing the tejpat leaf if using. Bring to a gentle simmer then take off the heat and remove the tejpat leaf.  
3. Once the prawns are cooked, drain them, pour over the sauce, and serve.

**Method**

1. Place all the ingredients except the fish fillets and vinegar in a pot. Bring to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes. Added water, and taste and adjust seasonings as needed  
2. Turn the heat down low. Add the fish and the white wine vinegar, and poach the fish until cooked, about 5–10 minutes. Serve the fish with the broth. 

# **Vegetables** {#vegetables}

## **Salads** {#salads}

Leafy greens were eaten at the start of meals. All three menus included in Martial's epigrams, for instance, open with lettuce accompanied by leeks, as does Pliny the Younger's menu. Though they don't state whether the lettuce was dressed, recipes from *Apicius* and comments from Galen imply that dressing with olive oil, vinegar, honey and/or *liquamen* was common. 

Lettuce was considered potentially indigestible. *Apicius 3.18.2* recommends an *oxyporium,* a highly-spiced mixture served with *oxygarum*, that is, vinegar and *liquamen*, in order to aid digestion. Columella includes another two recipes for *oxyporium*. 

**Recipes recreated:** *Apicius* 3.16, 3.18.1a, 3.18.2; *De Agricultura* 127;  *Columella* 12.59f  
**Recipes to try:**   
**Other recipes:** *Apicius* 1.34a, 1.34b, 3.18.1b; *Columella* 12.59e

### Leafy greens {#leafy-greens}

Apicius 3.16a

**Ingredients**

* Head romaine lettuce, rocket, endives, chicory, or other leafy greens  
* Olive oil  
* Fish sauce  
* Red wine vinegar

**Method**  
Wash and dry the lettuce leaves, and break into large bite-size pieces into a salad bowl. Drizzle with olive oil, fish sauce, and vinegar, and serve.

**Notes**

* Galen says that people eat boiled lettuce with this same combination of olive oil, fish sauce, and vinegar  
* Lettuce and rocket were a popular combination, as noted by Pliny the Elder and by Galen. Lettuce was considered cooling, and to be a sedative, while rocket was warming and an aphrodisiac, so the two balanced each other out.

### Endives or Lettuce {#endives-or-lettuce}

Apicius 3.18.1a

**Ingredients**

* Head romaine lettuce (or an endive)  
* Half of a small white onion, thinly sliced  
* Olive oil  
* Fish sauce

**Method**  
Wash and dry the lettuce leaves, and break into large bite-size pieces into a salad bowl. Add the thinly sliced onion. Drizzle with fish sauce and olive oil, toss, and serve.

**Notes**

* The recipe is for endives, but then suggests that endives are a good substitute for lettuce in winter. Given that endives are hard to find I suggest substituting with romaine lettuce.

### *Oxyporium* {#oxyporium}

Apicius 1.32 and 3.18.2

**Ingredients**

* 2 tsp ground cumin  
* 1 tsp ground ginger  
* 1 tsp ground pepper  
* ½ tsp dried rue  
* Half a date, finely chopped  
* 60g honey  
* 30ml vinegar  
* 20ml fish sauce

**Method**  
Mix all the ingredients together and let sit for half an hour, then strain through a sieve if desired. Serve with lettuce as a salad dressing, or consume alongside lettuce by the teaspoon. 

**Notes**

* In the original recipe, quantities are given for everything but the vinegar and fish sauce, which is unusual for ancient culinary recipes but common in medicina recipes. I've used a 2:1 honey to vinegar ratio, which is common in other recipes. *Oxygarum* is usually equal parts vinegar to fish sauce, but modern fish sauce is likely stronger than what the ancient Romans used so I've reduced the quantity of fish sauce somewhat.  
* This recipe is duplicated in Apicius, with 3.18.2 giving further details and stating that the *oxyporum* should be served with lettuce, to render the lettuce harmless. 

### *Oxyporium* {#oxyporium-1}

Columella 12.59e

**Ingredients**

* 1 tsp white pepper  
* ½ tsp celery seed  
* ½ tsp laser root  
* 1 tsp ground parmesan  
* 1 Tb honey  
* 1 Tb fish sauce

**Method**  
Mix all the ingredients together. Serve with lettuce as a salad dressing, or consume alongside lettuce by the teaspoon. 

### *Oxyporium* {#oxyporium-2}

Columella 12.59f

**Ingredients**

* ½ tsp white pepper  
* ½ tsp dried mint  
* ½ tsp lovage  
* ½ tsp raising, finely chopped  
* 2 Tb honey  
* 1 Tb red wine vinegar  
* 2 tsp fish sauce

**Method**  
Mix all the ingredients together. Serve with lettuce as a salad dressing, or consume alongside lettuce by the teaspoon. 

### Cabbage Salad {#cabbage-salad}

Mnesitheus, quoted in Oribasius *Medical Collections* 4.4.1, and Cato *De Agricultura*, 157

**Ingredients**

* 1 small cabbage  
* 2 tsp fresh rue, finely chopped  
* 3 tsp coriander leaf, chopped  
* ½  tsp asafoetida  
* 3 Tb honey  
* 1 Tb red wine vinegar  
* Salt

**Method**

1. Finely slice the cabbage, and toss together with the herbs, salt, and asafoetida.  
2. Mix together the honey and the vinegar. Pour over the salad, toss everything together, and serve.

**Notes**

* This recipe appears both in Oribasius, from the 4th century AD, but likely quoting from the (now lost) works of Mnesitheus, who lived in the 4th century BC  
* The recipe also appears in Cato, as well as in Pliny's *Natural Historia* in which Pliny used Cato as a source.  
* The recipe is medicinal \- it can allegedly cure headaches and is good for upset stomachs, at least, so says Pliny.

### Radishes {#radishes}

Apicius 3.14

**Ingredients**

* 5 medium radishes  
* 1 tsp fish sauce  
* ½ tsp black peppercorns

**Method**  
Slice the radishes. Ground the pepper corns with the fish sauce in a mortar and pestle, drizzle over the radishes, and serve.

* 1 tsp ground cumin  
* ½ tsp asafoetida  
* ½ tsp dried rue  
* 3 Tb red wine vinegar  
* 1 Tb liquamen  
* 1 Tb *defrutum*

**Method**

1. Cut the squash into large pieces then boil until *al dente*. Remove from the water and place in a dutch oven  
2. Mix the remaining ingredients together, then pour over the squash. Bring to a simmer and cook for a few minutes, sprinkle with pepper, and serve. 

### Gourd {#gourd-1}

Apicius 3.4.2

**Ingredients**

* 500 g squash (or gourd, if you can find it)  
* ½ tsp ground pepper  
* 1 tsp ground cumin  
* ½ tsp dried rue  
* 2 Tb water  
* 1½  Tb red wine vinegar  
* 1 Tb liquamen  
* ½ Tb olive oil  
* 2 tsp cornstarch

**Method**

1. Cut the squash into large pieces then boil until *al dente*. Remove from the water and place in a dutch oven  
2. Mix together all other ingredients except the cornstarch slurry and pour over the squash. Bring to a simmer and cook for a few minutes.  
3. Add the cornstarch slurry. Thicken for a couple minutes, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

**Notes**

* This is very similar both to the previous recipe, the main differences being the absence of *laser* and the thickening of the sauce  
* This is also very similar to *Apicius* 7.15, which is a sauce of taro differing only in the substitution of honey instead of vinegar

### Alexandrian Gourd {#alexandrian-gourd}

Apicius 3.4.3

**Ingredients**

* 1 kg squash (or gourd, if you can find it)

* 120 g honey  
* 60 ml fish sauce  
* 60 ml olive oil  
* 60 ml vinegar  
* 30 ml *defrutum*

**Method**

1. Cut the squash into large pieces then boil until *al dente*. Remove from the water and place in a baking dish.  
2. Place the dates in a bowl along with a little water, and microwave for a minute. Place a food processor along with the pine nuts, and blend into a coarse paste.  
3. Add the remaining ingredients to the food processor, and blend together.  
4. Pour the sauce over the squash, then cover with a lid or foil. Place in a preheated oven at 180 C / 350 F for 15 minutes, or until reheated. Season with pepper and serve.

### Cucumber Salad {#cucumber-salad}

* Ground black bepper

**Method**

1. Arrange the cucumber slices in a shallow dish. Combine the other ingredients together and pour over the cucumber. Cover the dish with cling wrap and leave in the fridge for a couple of hours.

**Notes**

* The recipe calls for either *passum* or honey. If using honey rather than passum add 2 Tb honey  
* The recipe itself states that adding *silphium* is optional, so you can omit this if you like

### Rock Melon {#rock-melon}

Apicius 3.7

**Ingredients**

* 300g cabbage  
* Pepper  
* ½ tsp lovage  
* 1 tsp rue

* 1 Tb white wine  
* 1 Tb olive oil

**Method**

1. Chop the cabbage into thin strips. Boil with water in a saucepan for 5-7 minutes, or until tender.  
2. Drain the water from the saucepan, then add the remaining ingredients. Return the saucepan to the heat for a couple minutes while mixing everything together, then serve.

### Cabbage with Onion {#cabbage-with-onion}

**Notes**

* The original recipe doesn't call for fish sauce, or indeed any source of salt, which appears to be an omission.   
* Recipe 3.9.3 is very similar, as is 3.9.1a above.

### Cabbage with Leek {#cabbage-with-leek}

Apicius 3.9.3

**Ingredients**

* 500g cabbage

2. Drain the turnips, and place them back in the saucepan. Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a simmer, then serve. 

**Notes**

* On reflection I think these should be mashes, see Vinidarius 7 for similar but more detailed instructions

### Celery Mash {#celery-mash}

Apicius 3.15.2

**Ingredients**

* 1 head of celery  
* 1 onions, peeled and cut in half  
* 1 tsp baking soda  
* ½ tsp ground pepper  
* ½ tsp dried lovage  
* 1 tsp dried oregano  
* 120 ml white wine

* 15 ml olive oil

**Method**

1. Place the celery, onion, and baking soda in a large saucepan. Cover in water, bring to the boil, and then simmer for 15 minutes.  
2. Drain the water from the saucepan, then leave the celery and onions to cool for a few minutes.  
3. Place the celery and onions into a food processor along with the remaining ingredients and puree  
4. Pour the puree into a saucepan. Bring gently to heat for a few minutes, then serve

### Lettuce Mash {#lettuce-mash}

*Holus molle ex foliis lactucarum*, Apicius 3.15.3

**Ingredients**

* 1 head of lettuce  
* 2 onions, peeled and cut in half  
* 1 tsp baking soda  
* Pepper  
* ½ tsp dried lovage  
* ½ tsp celery seeds, ground in mortar and pestle  
* 1 tsp dried mint  
* 2 Tb fish sauce  
* 2 Tb olive oil  
* 2 Tb white wine

**Method**

1. Place the lettuce, onions, and baking soda in a large saucepan. Cover in water, bring to the boil, and then simmer for 15 minutes.  
2. Drain the water from the saucepan, then leave the lettuce and onions to cool for a few minutes.  
3. Once cool enough to handle, squeeze as much liquid as you can out of the lettuce and onions, then finely dice and place into a serving bowl.  
4. Mix together the pepper, herbs, fish sauce, olive oil, and wine, then pour over puree. Toss the mixture and serve.

**Notes**

* Recipes 3.15.1 and 3.15.2 give very similar recipes for pureed alexanders and celery, also cooked in soda. Recipe 3.1 simple states that leaf vegetables become emerald green if cooked in soda.   
* Pliny notes that the Apician method for cooking cabbage is with soda, which helps them retain their colour.  
* It is unclear if the onion is supposed to be cooked with the cabbage. In the Grainger & Grocock text the onions are cooked, but the other texts bracket the heading differently to imply that the onions are not cooked.

### Sauteed Greens {#sauteed-greens}

*Rapas*, Apicius 3.16b

**Ingredients**

* 500 g fresh leafy vegetables   
  (eg spinach, chard, mustard greens)  
* 1 Tb fish sauce  
* 1 Tb olive oil  
* 2 tsp white wine vinegar  
* Ground pepper  
* 1 tsp cumin  
* 10 small grains of mastic gum

2. Crush the mastic gum in a mortar and pestle. Place all of the ingredients into a frying pan and saute the greens until cooked, adding a little water if desired.

### Artichoke

Apicius 3.19.3

**Ingredients**

* 1 globe artichoke bulb  
* 1½   Tb olive oil  
* 2 tsp fish sauce  
* A pinch of cumin  
* Ground black pepper

**Method**

1. Steam the artichoke for 25–35 minutes, until the outer leaves can easily be pulled off. Alternatively, wrap the artichoke in damp paper towels and microwave for 10 minutes.  
2. Mix together the remaining ingredients in a small bowl. Dip the leaves and eat the normal way, then remove the choke and eat the heart with the sauce.

**Notes**

* This recipe was originally for cardoons, of which the artichoke is a cultivated variety. It's unclear whether the ancient Romans cultivated artichokes or consumed wild cardoons, but since cardoons are difficult to find I've substituted the artichokes instead. 

### Carrots {#carrots}

Apicius 3.21.3

**Ingredients**

* 4 carrots, chop the carrot in bite-sized piece  
* ½ tsp cumin  
* 30 ml olive oil  
* 90 ml white wine  
* 15 ml fish sauce

**Method**

1. Place in a frying pan and cover with water. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the carrots are soft.  
2. Drain the frying pan and then return the carrots to the frying pan. Add the remaining ingredients, fry until the wine is reduced, and serve.

### Taro {#taro}

Apicius 7.15

1. Peel and cut the taro into large cubes. Place in boiling water and cook for 12–15 minutes, or until cooked but not too mushy, then drain.   
2. Mix the remaining ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the cornstarch to thicken, then pour over the taro and serve.

**Notes**

* Last time I made this the taro turned to mush

### Libum {#libum}

*De Agricultura* 75

**Ingredients**

* 250g ricotta  
* 125g whole wheat flour  
* 1 egg  
* Bay leaves  
* Olive oil  
* Honey for serving

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 180 C  
2. Thoroughly mix together the ricotta, flour, and eggs along with a pinch of salt. Shape into a round loaf.  
3. Lightly grease a small dutch oven with a little olive oil. Lightly coat the bay leaves in olive oil then place to cover the bottom of the dutch oven. Put the loaf on top, and then bake with the lid on for about 1.5 hours, until golden and firm.  
4. Once baked, cut into slices, cover in honey, and serve immediately.

**Notes**

* *Libum* was sometimes used to refer to the sacrificial cakes offered to household spirits, which may explain why Cato included a recipe in his work on agriculture. Cato does not say to serve with honey, but as noted in *The Classical Cookbook* all other ancient authors associate the cake with honey, and it certainly tastes better this way. 

### Savillum {#savillum}

*De Agricultura 84*  
**Ingredients**

* 750 g ricotta

1. Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F  
2. In a mixing bowl, mix together the ricotta, flour, honey, and egg, until well-combined  
3. Grease a deep pie dish or cake pan. Pour the cake batter into the dish, then place in the oven and bake for 60 minutes.  
4. Once 60 minutes have passed, checked whether the cake is cooked through by sticking a skewer through the middle — it should come out clean. If not, continue baking until cooked through.  
5. Once the cake is cooked, take it out of the oven. Cover it in the honey, sprinkle over poppy seeds, and then place back into the oven for a final 10 minutes. Serve immediately.
