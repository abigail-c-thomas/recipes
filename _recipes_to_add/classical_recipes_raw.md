3. Add the remaining ingredients to the dutch oven. Bring to a gentle simmer, then place the lid off and cook for an hour, or until the beef is tender. 

**Notes**

* The recipe is for onion, or leek, or taro, or quince. I've not yet tried with taro or quince but both seem interesting

### Kandaulos {#kandaulos}

**Ingredients**

* 800 g diced beef (or lamb or pork)  
* 750 ml beef stock

* 200 g Feta cheese  
* 2 tsp dried dill leaf

4. Simmer for a further 15 minutes, adding water if needed, then serve.

## **Salted Meat** {#salted-meat}

### Ham Shoulder in Pastry {#ham-shoulder-in-pastry}

Apicius 7.9.1

**Ingredients**

* 1.5 kg ham shoulder  
* 10 dried figs  
* 3 bay leaves  
* 200 g white flour  
* 2 Tb olive oil  
* ¼ tsp salt  
* 100 ml water  
* 100 g set honey

**Method**

1. Boil the ham shoulder with the figs and the bay leaves for about 1.5 hours, or until cooked. Remove the ham shoulder from the water and allow it to cool.  
2. Prepare the pastry by mixing together the flour, salt, and oil, then combining with water to form a dough. Need until smooth and pliable.  
3. Remove the skin of the ham (if present) and score meat in a grid fashion. Pour of the honey. Next roll out the pastry into a thin sheet with a rolling pin. Place the ham in the center and wrap so that it is entirely enclosed, sealing the edges.  
4. Place the ham in a preheated oven at 190 C/375 F and bake for 50 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp. Remove from the oven and serve.

**Notes**

* I still need to get this recipe right, as the honey leaks out. Probably should up the olive oil (the recipe doesn't say to use water, but that might just be an omission), maybe also make a bit more pastry  
* The liquor the ham is cooked in can be used to boil barley, which goes well with the meal  
* Ham wrapped in pastry was part of the luxurious dish *tetrapharmakum*, allegedly invented by junior emperor Aelius Verus (d. 138\) and enjoyed by both Hadrian and Alexander Septimus. This information is from the notorious *Historia Augusta*, where it is credited to Marius Maximus's biography of Hadrian.  
* Modern versions of this recipe exist, such as ham en croute. Not sure the subsequent history but plausibly this has survived through time

### Salted Shoulder of Pork {#salted-shoulder-of-pork}

Apicius 7.9.3

**Ingredients**

* 700 g gammon or smoked ham  
* 250 g pearl barley  
* 10 dried figs  
* 100 g honey  
* 250 ml white wine  
* 250 ml *passum*  
* 2 tsp dried rue  
* ½ tsp black pepper  
* 30 ml *liquamen*  
* 6 *mustacei* (must cakes, see recipe)

**Method**

1. Place the meat in a large saucepan with the barley and figs. Add water to cover. Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 hour.  
2. Preheat the oven to 400F/200C. Remove the meat from the saucepan, and place on a baking tray, and allow to cool for a few minutes. Then cover with the honey and place in the oven for 30 minutes.  
3. While the meat is in the oven, prepare the sauce by combining the white wine, *passum*, rue, pepper, and *liquamen* in a bowl. Mix together and adjust as desired.  
4. Once the pork is cooked, carve and plate with the mustacei broken in half, then pour over the sauce. Serve along with the barley and figs.

**Notes**

* Recipe 7.9.2 is similar and suggests using plain bread (though must cakes are apparently better). Rather then specify the sauce it sauces to use *caroenum* or spice wine.

### Lard {#lard}

Apicius 7.9.4

**Ingredients**

*  200 g lardo or salted pork fat  
* 1 tsp dried dill  
* Salt  
* Olive oil

### White Sauce for Boiled Meat {#white-sauce-for-boiled-meat}

Apicius 7.6.4

**Ingredients**

* 800 g cut of beef, lamb, or pork suitable for slow cooking  
* 50 ml \+ 40 ml fish sauce  
* 200 ml white wine  
* 2 pieces of bread, crust removed  
* 1 brown onion, peeled and cut in half  
* 60 g pine nuts  
* 1 tsp rue  
* 2 Tb honey  
* 1 Tb oil  
* Ground pepper

**Method**

1. Place the meat in a saucepan along with 50 ml of fish sauce and half of the brown onion. Add enough water to cover the meat, then simmer with the lid on for 2 hours, or until the meat is cooked and falling apart. Check periodically to make sure enough water remains, and add more if needed.  
2. Once the meat is cooked, take 100 ml of the cooking liquid and pour onto the bread to soak for a few minutes.   
3. Add the bread, the remaining 40 ml of fish sauce and half an onion, along with the pine nuts, rue, honey, oil, and a generous helping of ground pepper to a food processor. Process until smooth.  
4. Pour the sauce into a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, or until the onion flavour mellows. Adjust with fish sauce or honey as desired.   
5. Carve the meat, and serve smothered in the sauce.

**Notes**

* You can add vegetables like carrots or parsnips to the meat as it cooks, and serve as side dishes  
* Any leftover cooking liquid can be used as stock for other recipes - for instance, to cook barley or lentils. If you like, you can add herbs (such as parsley, coriander, or bay leaf) while cooking the meat to further enhance the flavour of the stock. 

### Tripe {#tripe}

*Apicius* 7.1.5

**Ingredients**

* 400 g tripe  
* 1 Tb fish sauce  
* ½ tsp asafoetida  
* Black pepper

**Method**

4. In a jug, combine the remaining ingredients along with a tablespoon of olive oil. Pour over the rabbit, tossing the pieces to make sure everything is covered, then return to the oven.  
5. Cook for a further 10–15 minutes, basting after 5 minutes. Once the juices run clear the meat is cooked. Serve the rabbit with a little of the pan juices

**Notes**

* This recipe is for hare but hare is impossible to find here, so I've substituted rabbit

# **Poultry** {#poultry}

## **Chicken** {#chicken}

### Chicken in Dill Sauce {#chicken-in-dill-sauce}

*Pullum anetatum* - Apicius 6.8.1-2

* 1 tsp mustard seed  
* A pinch of asafoetida  
* 2 tsp dried mint  
* 3 Tb fish sauce  
* 2 Tb white wine vinegar

3. Place the chicken thighs in a roasting tin. Pour the sauce over the chicken so that it is completely covered on all sides.  
4. Place the chicken in the oven for about 45 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Baste the chicken with the sauce every 10 minutes or so. Once cooked, serve sprinkled with pepper.

**Notes**

* This is, with minor adjustments, the recipe suggested on pg 67-8 of Sally Grainger's *Cooking Apicius*

### Parthian Chicken {#parthian-chicken}

Apicius 6.8.3  
**Ingredients**

*Pullum anetatum* \- Apicius 6.8.1-2
* 200 ml white wine  
* 30 ml fish sauce  
* 1 tsp lovage  
* 1 tsp caraway seed  
* ½ tsp asafoetida  
* Black pepper

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C / 350 F.  
2. Dry-fry the caraway seeds, then grind in a mortar and pestle. Combine in a measuring jug with wine, fish sauce, lovage, and asafoetida, along with a generous amount of ground black pepper.  
3. Place the chicken in a casserole dish, skin side up. Pour the sauce over the chicken, then place in the oven uncovered and bake for 50 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.  
4. Once the chicken is cooked, remove from the oven, sprinkle with extra black pepper, and serve.

**Notes**

* This dish is named after Parthia. This could be because it is stylistically similar to a Parthian dish, though lovage and caraway both are distinctly Roman ingredients this seems unlikely. Instead the dish may be named because of its prominent use of *asafoetida*, known in Latin as Parthian *laser* to distinguish from *silphium*, which was called Cyrenaican *laser*.  
* Apicius 6.8.6, for chicken in a *laser* sauce, is very similar, merely lacking the caraway seeds. So if you don't like / don't have caraway seeds, you can make this recipe authentically without them. 

### Chicken in Sour Sauce {#chicken-in-sour-sauce}

Apicius 6.8.4

**Ingredients**

* 4 chicken thighs  
* 1 small leak, thoroughly washed  
* A couple sprigs of parsley  
* 1 ½ tsp black pepper  
* 50 ml olive oil  
* 40 ml fish sauce  
* 40 ml white wine  
* 30 ml white wine vinegar

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C / 350 F.  
2. Place the chicken in a dutch oven, skin side up, along with the leak. Add the remaining ingredients to the dutch oven, place in the oven, and cook for 50 minutes.  
3. Discard the leak and the parsley. Plate the chicken, drizzled with some of the sauce, and serve.

### Numidian Chicken {#numidian-chicken}

Apicius 6.8.5

**Ingredients**

* 4 chicken thighs, with skin and bone  
* 2x ½ tsp of asafoetida, separated  
* 30 g pine nuts  
* 4 dates   
* Pepper  
* 2 tsp cumin  
* 2 tsp coriander seed  
* 1 tsp rue  
* 2 Tb vinegar  
* 2 Tb honey  
* 3 Tb liquamen  
* 2 Tb oil  
* 1.5 Tb cornstarch, made into a slurry

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F  
2. Rub a ½ tsp of asafoetida onto the chicken thighs, then sprinkle ground pepper over. Place in a roasting tray and roast for 45 minutes, or until cooked through and the skin is golden  
3. Place the dates in a bowl with a little water and microwave for 1 minute to soften. Place in a food processor with the pine nuts and blend into a paste.  
4. Add the pine nut/date paste to a saucepan along with the remaining ingredients (excluding the cornstarch slurry). Add a generous amount of ground pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for a couple minutes. Taste and adjust as desired - you may wish to add a couple tablespoons of water to reduce the intensity of the sauce.  
5. Add the cornstarch slurry, a little at a time, while the saucepan is over the heat, until a thick consistency is reached.    
6. Plate the chicken thighs and then cover in the sauce. Sprinkle on some additional black pepper.

**Notes**

* This dish might be named after Numidia, a region in North Africa. It is also possible it is named after the guinea fowl, usually *meleagris* but also known as the *gallina Numidica* - the modern scientific name is *Numida meleagris*. Indeed, the term *pullum* used throughout Section 6.8 means "chicken" but can also be used for fowl more broadly, and guinea fowl could be used as an authentic substitute for chicken in any of them

### Vardanian Chicken {#vardanian-chicken}

Apicius 6.8.11

**Ingredients**

* 6 chicken thighs  
* 1 leek  
* 1 bundle of coriander leaves  
* 1 tsp savoury  
* 400 ml wine  
* 60 ml fish sauce  
* 2 Tb olive oil  
* Pepper  
* 100 g pine nuts, ground  
* 250 ml milk  
* 3 egg whites

**Method**

1. Place the chicken thighs in a dutch oven along with the wine, fish sauce, olive oil, and savoury. Wash leek and coriander leaves, then place them on top without chopping. Bring to a simmer, then cook with the lid on for 25 minutes  
2. Remove the leek and coriander leaves from the pot, then add the pine nuts, milk, and a generous amount of pepper. Beat the egg whites with a fork, then pour them over, making sure to stir so that they don't immediately curdle. Gently heat until the sauce thickens and begins to break, then serve.

### Frontonian Chicken {#frontonian-chicken}

Apicius 6.8.12

**Ingredients**

* 1 kg chicken thighs, with skin and bone  
* 2 Tb olive oil  
* 2 Tb fish sauce  
* 1 leek, sliced in half  
* 1 tsp dill leaf  
* ½ tsp dried savoury  
* 1 small handful coriander leaf  
* 120 ml *defrutum*  
* Pepper

**Method**

1. Place a large dutch oven on high heat. Place the chicken skin side down, and fry until the skin is golden. Flip and brown on the meat side.  
2. Add the olive oil, fish sauce, leek, and herbs, along with 100 ml of water. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.  
3. Remove the chicken from the cooking liquor. Plate each thigh with just a little of the cooking liquor. Drizzle on a tablespoon or so of *defrutum*, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

**Notes**

* The broth and leek are not eaten, probably because they look unappetizing, but they taste really good  
* The Fronto referred to is likely the same author who wrote sections 7.12, 7.22, and 19.2 of *The Geoponica*. Plausibly this "Fronto" is Sextus Julius Frontinus (c. 40 – 103), a Roman senator and consul known chiefly now for having written a treatise on aqueduct.

### Chicken *Tractogalatus* {#chicken-tractogalatus}

*Pullus Tractogalatus* \- Apicius 6.8.13

**Ingredients**

* 4 chicken thighs, with skin and bone  
* 300 ml white wine  
* 60 ml fish sauce  
* 1 onion, peeled and slice in half  
* 1 small handful of coriander leaves  
* 2 Tb olive olive  
* 400 ml of milk  
* 4 heaped Tb semolina  
* 2 Tb \+ 2 Tb honey  
* Pepper  
* ½ tsp dried lovage  
* 1 tsp dried oregano  
* 2 Tb *defrutum*  
* 2 Tb cornstarch, mixed with water into a slurry

**Method**

1. Add the white wine, fish sauce, onion, coriander leaves, and olive oil to a large saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the chicken thighs and simmer for about 25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.  
2. Add the milk, semolina, and 2 Tb honey to a separate saucepan, along with a couple pinches of salt. Heat and stir until it becomes very thick, being careful not to let it burn.  
3. Once the chicken is cooked, remove from the cooking liquor. Cover in the semolina mixture and place onto a serving dish. Add the rest of the semolina around the chicken.  
4. Prepare the sauce by adding the lovage, oregano, generous ground pepper, *defrutum*, final 2 Tb honey, and 200 ml of the chicken cooking liquor to another saucepan. Bring to a boil, then add the cornstarch slurry to thicken.  
5. Pour the thickened sauce over the chicken and semolina, then serve.

**Notes**

* *Tractogalatus* means milk with *tracta*, an uncooked dough often used to thicken Roman sauces. I have used semolina as a substitute.  
* The final presentation of this dish is a little unclear to me. It seems that the milk/semolina mixture is supposed to adhere to the chicken in one solid mass. Perhaps the chicken and semolina mixture could be put into an oven at a low temperature for a few minutes while the sauce cooks?  
* Alternative, for modern sensibilities it might be better to serve the chicken on the semolina with the sauce on the side.

2. Rotate the duck, then bake for another 20 minutes. Baste with *defrutum*, then bake for another 10 minutes. Baste once more, then roast another 5–10 minutes or until cooked. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before carving.  
3. While the duck roasts, coarsely chop the onions, then place in a saucepan along with the remaining sauce ingredients. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, then take off the heat and allow to cool.  
4. Place the sauce into a food processor and blend until smooth. Pour back into the saucepan and bring gently back to heat. Serve the duck with the sauce. 

**Notes**

* I didn't get the duck skin crispy with the above method and tbh wasn't that impressed, maybe should try [this method](https://mapleleaffarms.com/recipes/roasted-whole-duck-basic-recipe-for-crispy-skin) next?  
* Also had difficulty getting the duck defrosted, it needs at least 2 days in the fridge

**Duck with Turnips**  
*Apicius 6.8.3*

*Wash and prepare the crane or duck. Boil it in a pot with water, salt, and dill until half-cooked. Separately, cook the turnips until their bitterness is removed. Remove the bird from the pot, wash it again, and place it in a pan with oil, fish sauce, and a bundle of leek and coriander. Add the washed and finely chopped turnips on top, ensuring everything cooks together. Toward the end of cooking, add a small amount of* defrutum *to color the dish. Prepare a sauce by grinding pepper, cumin, coriander, and* laser *root. Moisten with vinegar and the cooking broth, then pour it over the duck in the pot and let it boil. Thicken with starch, pour the sauce over the turnips, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.*

**Ingredients**

* 1 whole duck (about 2 kg)  
* 600 g turnips, peeled and diced  
* 2 tsp salt  
* 2 tsp dried dill  
* 3 tbsp olive oil

* ½ tsp asafoetida  
* 2 tbsp red wine vinegar  
* 1½  Tb cornstarch mixed with water into a slurry

**Method**

1. Remove the wings and neck from the duck and trim any excess skin and fat. Place the duck in a large dutch oven along with the trimmings and giblets (if included). Add the salt and dill along with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 45 minutes, until the duck is half-cooked  
2. Place the diced turnips in a separate pot. Bring to a boil, then immediately remove from the heat, pour out the hot water, and shock with cold water.  
3. Remove the duck from the pot and reserve the stock for later. Clean out the dutch oven and then place the duck back inside.  
4. Add the olive oil, fish sauce, leak, and coriander to the dutch oven, then add the cooked turnips on top. Cover and simmer on low heat for about 45 minutes, or until everything is cooked. Drizzle the *defrutum* over the duck mid-way through the cooking.  
5. While the duck is cooking, combine the ground pepper, cumin, coriander seed, and asafoetida with the vinegar. Add 400 ml of the reserved stock, first skimming off the fat  
6. Once the duck is cooked, remove and discard the leek and coriander. Pour over the sauce, then bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust the sauce as needed, then add the cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce.  
7. Remove the duck, turnips, and sauce to a serving platter. Carve the duck and serve with the turnip and sauce.

1. Roast hazelnuts at 180℃ for 10 minutes, then blend into a fine crumb  
2. Place the duck pieces into an oven dish, skin up. Season with pepper.  
3. Combine the wine, fish sauce, oil, vinegar, honey, and herbs into a mixing jug and stir to combine. Pour three quarters of the liquid over the duck.  
4. Mix the remaining liquid with the hazelnut. Pat down the hazelnut mixture onto the exposed skin of the duck to form a coat. (Any remaining hazelnut mixture should be added to the oven dish, where it will float.)  
5. Roast the duck at 180℃ for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve with a little of the cooking liquid.

### Duck with Turnips {#duck-with-turnips}

Modified from *A Taste of Ancient Rome*, page 110\.  (Also should add dill?)

**Ingredients**

* 4 duck leg and thighs  
* 1 Tb olive oil  
* 1 Tb garum  
* 1 small leek, sliced  
* 700g of turnips  
* 120 ml of wine  
* 2 tsp cumin  
* 2 tsp coriander seed  
* 1 tsp asafoetida  
* 1 Tb vinegar  
* 1 tsp cornstarch, mixed with water into a slurry

**Method**

1. Begin by boiling all but one of the turnips in a large amount of water. This should take around 25 minutes. Once they are cooked, they can be sliced.  
2. While the turnips are boiling, brown the duck, skin side down, in a dutch oven. Once golden, flip and add the leek and garum, and fry until browned.  
3. Slice one turnip and add to the duck. Then add the wine, and simmer covered for about 15 minutes, or until the duck is cooked through.  
4. Add the spices and the vinegar to the duck. Thicken, as desired, with the cornstarch. Then add the sliced boiled turnips to the duck, and serve.

*Note:* The turnips are boiled separately from the duck to remove their bitter flavour. If the turnips are substituted for other root vegetables, such as parsnip or carrot, the vegetables can be boiled together with the duck.

## **Apician Sauces for Fish** {#apician-sauces-for-fish}

Between *Apicius* Books 9 and 10 and *Vinidarius* there are about 45 distinct recipes for specific fish sauces. 

**Recipes recreated:** *Apicius* 10.1.1, 10.1.2, 10.2.4/10.3.1

### Herb Sauce for Fried Fish {#herb-sauce-for-fried-fish}

Apicius 10.1.1

**Ingredients**

* 500g fish fillets, or a whole 750g fish  
* ½ tsp ground black pepper  
* ½ tsp cumin  
* ½ tsp coriander seed  
* ½ tsp asafoetida  
* ½ tsp dried oregano  
* ½ tsp dried rue  
* 4 dates, minced (or 2 Tb date syrup)  
* 1 Tb olive oil (additional for frying)  
* 2 Tb honey  
* 2 Tb *defrutum*  
* 3 Tb red wine vinegar  
* 1½ Tb *liquamen* 

**Method**

1. Add all of the ingredients (other than the fish) to a small saucepan, mix together, and gently bring to a simmer for a few minutes. Taste and adjust as needed, then turn down the heat to keep warm while the fish is being fried.   
2. Heat a little olive oil in a skillet, then fry the fish until cooked.   
3. Plate the fish with the sauce drizzled over it, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

**Notes**

* Vinidarius 8 is very similar, and both texts clearly share a common origin. The sauce is slightly different in that it omits cumin and honey  
* Interesting the dates in Apicius 10.1.1 appear with the liquids and perhaps refers to date syrup, while those in Vinidarius 8 are explicitly pounded  
* Both recipes say that they can be used on any fish

### Sauce for Boiled Fish {#sauce-for-boiled-fish}

Apicius 10.1.2

**Ingredients**

* ½ tsp ground pepper  
* ½ tsp lovage  
* 1 tsp cumin

* 2 Tb date syrup  
* 2 Tb honey  
* 2 Tb vinegar

* 1 Tb olive oil

**Method**

1. Mix everything into a small saucepan, bring to a simmer, then serve with the fish.

**Notes**

* Makes enough for 750 g of fish  
* This is similar to a number of the other sauces. *Vinidarius* 18, which differs only in having celery seed rather than onion, is particularly close, but *Apicius* 10.2.4/10.3.1, 10.2.6, 10.2.11, and 10.2.16 are all similar, as are a number of sauces in Book 6, 7, and 8\.

* 1 large white onion, finely diced  
* 1 tsp fish sauce  
* 2 Tb olive oil  
* 1 Tb honey  
* 2 tsp *defrutum*  
* 2 tsp vinegar  
* 1 tsp dried savoury

**Method**

2. When ready to cook, place the onions in a frying pan along with the fish sauce, olive oil, and 2 Tb of water. Cook for about 5 minutes or until the onions are translucent.  
3. Drain the salted fish and place in the frying pan, and cook until the fish is almost done.  
4. Add the remaining ingredients to the frying pan. Mix everything together for a few minutes, then taste and adjust seasonings if needed. Remove from the heat and serve.

**Notes**

* I haven't yet worked out how long to soak salt fish, my first attempt was too salty  
* Apicius 4.2.24 gives a similar recipe for salt fish

### Tuna Salad {#tuna-salad}

Apicius 9.10.2

**Ingredients**

* 200g canned tuna  
* Ground black pepper  
* ½ tsp dried lovage  
* ½ tsp dried thyme  
* ½ tsp dried rue  
* 2 tsp date syrup  
* 2 tsp honey  
* 1 boiled egg  
* 1 tsp wine  
* 1 tsp vinegar  
* 1 tsp *defrutum*  
* 2 Tb olive oil

**Method**  
Mix the tuna with the herbs, date syrup, and honey. Add ground pepper and salt to taste. Place into a small serving dish. Slice the boiled egg and place on top to decorate. Mix the wine, vinegar, *defrutum*, and olive oil together and use to dress the tuna.

**Notes**

* This recipe is originally for bonito, but that is hard to find.  
* This recipe, and indeed all the bonito recipes, have no fish sauce or salt of any kind. My guess is that the bonito was salted, and definitely the recipe tastes better with salt.

### Poached Fish {#poached-fish}

Apicius 10.1.5

**Ingredients**

* 400 g white fish fillet  
* ½ tsp ground black pepper  
* 1 tsp coriander seed  
* ½ tsp dried dill leaf  
* 30 ml fish sauce  
* 400 ml water

1. Choose a frying pan just large enough to fit the pieces of fish. Add the spices, fish sauce, and water to the pan, and bring to a simmer.  
2. Add the fish, then reduce the heat so that the water remains below a simmer. Poach the fish until cooked, about 5–10 minutes.  
3. Remove the fish from the poaching liquid and serve sprinkled with a little vinegar and pepper.

### Baked Horse-Mackerel {#baked-horse-mackerel}

Athenaeus 322c-d, quoting a lost play by Alexis

**Ingredients**

* A 500g horse-mackerel (or any white fish fillet)  
* 125g chevre cheese (or feta, or other strongly flavoured cheese)  
* ½ tsp of asafoetida  
* 1 tsp dried oregano, or leaves from two fresh sprigs

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F.  
2. If using a whole mackerel, split open the fish down the belly and open it out. Remove the spine and as many bones as you can, then place flesh side up onto a baking tray. (If using fish fillets, simply place on a baking tray with skin, if present touching the tray.)  
3. Evenly sprinkle salt and asafoetida over the fish. Next, crumble over the cheese, then finally sprinkle over the oregano.  
4. Place in the oven to bake for 20 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. Then turn on the broiler and broil until the cheese is golden brown. 

### Fish with White-Sauce {#fish-with-white-sauce}

Galen *On the Power of Foods* R18

**Ingredients**

* 450g salmon fillets  
* 1 leek, finely chopped  
* 1 tsp dried dill leaf  
* 1 Tb olive oil, plus more for serving  
* Salt

**Method**

1. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan. Add the leeks and gently fry for a few minutes.  
2. Add the salmon, along with 150ml of water, the dill leaf, and a few pinches of salt. Simmer until the salmon is cooked and the sauce has reduced somewhat. Drizzle on some more olive oil, if desired, and serve.

**Notes**

* Galen doesn't specify which fish to use, but it is in the section for fish with "soft flesh". I think it works well with salmon, a river fish from northern Europe rarely mentioned by Greek writers but praised by Latin ones. Both Cassiodorus and Anthimus recommended it to German kings in the 6th century.

### Fried calamari {#fried-calamari}

Apicius 9.3.1

* Generous ground black pepper

**Method**

1. Thoroughly dry the calamari with a paper towel  
2. Place the olive oil in a frying pan and place on high heat. When the pan is very hot, add the calamari and fry for a couple minutes, until the calamari is opaque and beginning to curl.  
3. Add in the remaining ingredients. Toss everything together for a minute, take off the heat, and serve.

### Prawns in cumin sauce {#prawns-in-cumin-sauce}
