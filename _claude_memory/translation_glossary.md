# Translation Glossary for Latin Culinary Terms

This glossary provides consistent translations for Latin terms found in Apicius and Vinidarius recipes.

## Style Notes and Guidelines

1. **Untranslated Terms**: The following terms should be kept in Latin and italicized rather than translated:
   - *alica* - do not translate as bulgur wheat
   - *caccabina* - do not translate as pot dish
   - *caroenum* - do not translate as reduced wine
   - *defrutum* - do not translate as grape must
   - *folium* - do not translate as cinnamon leaf
   - *laser* - keep Latin with asafoetida in parentheses if needed
   - *ofellae* - do not translate as meat cuts
   - *passum* - do not translate as raisin wine
   - *tracta* - do not translate as pastry or pasta
   
2. **Latin Titles**: When translating dish names, preserve the Latin name in bold at the beginning, followed by the English translation.
   
3. **Punctuation**: Maintain the Latin punctuation style when quoting directly from Apicius or Vinidarius. For translations, modern English punctuation should be used.
   
4. **Format for Measurements**: When translating measurements, keep the original Latin term with the approximate modern equivalent in brackets, e.g., "sextarius [~500ml]".
   
5. **Handling Uncertain Terms**: When a term's meaning is uncertain, indicate this in the translation with options or a note of uncertainty.
   
6. **Glosses**: When a Latin term appears in the main English translation text, it should be italicized and may be followed by a brief explanation in parentheses upon first use in each recipe.

7. **Formatting for Recipe Pages**:
   - Original text section should be titled "### Original Text" (regardless of whether it's Latin or Greek)
   - English translation section should be titled "### English Translation"
   - Original text should be italicized
   - English translation should NOT be italicized, except for Latin/Greek terms (see point 1)
   - Both sections should be followed by the source attribution with the book, section, and approximate date
   - Place a horizontal rule (___) after the attribution
   - Begin descriptive text with "Claude's intro:" to indicate AI-generated content
   
8. **Translation Approach**: 
   - Aim for clarity while staying true to the original text
   - Maintain the imperative tone of the original instructions
   - Add implied words in square brackets [like this] when needed for clarity
   - Keep sentence structure as close to the original as possible, but modify when needed for English readability
   - Use simple, direct English that reflects the practical nature of the recipes

9. **Handling Variants**: When multiple versions of a recipe exist, include all variants and clearly indicate which is which. Use "aliter" (another way) as it appears in the original text.

10. **Measurements and Quantities**: When the Latin text uses specific quantities, maintain these in the translation rather than converting to modern measurements. Include any necessary context in brackets.

11. **Dating Conventions**: Consistently date Apicius to the 4th century CE (not 4th-5th century). The collection was likely compiled in its present form during this period.

12. **Fragmentary Greek Texts**: The Heidelberg papyrus is a fragmentary document with many gaps and uncertainties in the text. When reproducing this text:
    - Preserve line breaks as they appear in the papyrus
    - Include angle brackets < > and dots ... to indicate missing or illegible text
    - Format as *Original Text* (not "Original Greek")
    - Include notation in the English translation about fragmentary nature where relevant
    - Date consistently to "c. 300" or "c. 3rd century CE"
