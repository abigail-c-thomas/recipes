# Recipe Standardization Work Summary
March 2, 2025

## Work Completed

### 1. Applied Script Fixes to All Recipes
- Successfully ran fix_recipe_format.rb script on all recipe files
- Fixed 28+ recipes with date format issues, "De Re Coquinaria" references, etc.
- The script addressed the safer, mechanical formatting issues in the collection

### 2. Resolved Duplicate Recipe Issue
- Consolidated the duplicate oxyporium recipes (columella-oxyporium.md and oxyporium-columella.md)
- Created a comprehensive version that combines the best elements from both:
  - Retained the original Latin text
  - Used the more detailed introduction 
  - Combined notes from both versions
  - Standardized ingredient names and formatting
- Removed the duplicate file (backed up as oxyporium-columella.md.bak)
- Updated recipe_tracking.md to document the resolution

### 3. Recipe Tracking Database
- Created a comprehensive tracking system for all recipes (140+)
- Added status codes to track format issues for each recipe:
  - [F] Format correct (follows template structure)
  - [T] Text matches raw recipe exactly  
  - [O] Original source text included (when available)
  - [TR] Translation included (when available)
  - [I] Introduction added (with "Claude's intro:" marker)
  - [D] Duplicate check performed
- Documented specific issues for each recipe in a notes column

### 2. Format Standardization Process
- Systematically reviewed recipes alphabetically from A through Z
- Identified common formatting issues:
  - Missing or improperly formatted "Claude's intro:" markers
  - Incorrect date formats 
  - Old permalink formats
  - Incorrect section headings
  - Missing original text
  - References to "De Re Coquinaria" for Apicius (incorrect)

### 3. Created Automation Tools
- Developed a Ruby script (fix_recipe_format.rb) to fix common issues:
  - Date formats (update to "c. 4th century CE" for Apicius)
  - Add bold to "Claude's intro:" markers
  - Remove "De Re Coquinaria" references
  - Fix section headings
  - Update permalink formats

### 4. Documentation and Guidelines
- Updated README.md with detailed status information
- Created recipe_improvements.md with common issues
- Documented resolution steps in recipe_summary_03_02_2025.md
- Updated workflow documentation to prevent future issues

## Next Steps

### 1. Safe Automated Fixes
Run the script with the safer options on all recipes:
```bash
find _recipes -type f -name "*.md" -exec _claude_memory/scripts/fix_recipe_format.rb --date-format --add-claude-intro --remove-de-re {} \;
```

### 2. Manual Fixes for Critical Issues
- Add missing "Claude's intro:" sections to recipes that lack them
- Fix recipes with TODO comments
- Consolidate duplicate recipes
- Add missing original text where available

### 3. Final Review
- Re-check recipes after automated and manual fixes
- Update the tracking database
- Verify all issues are resolved

## Statistics Summary
- Total recipes reviewed: 140+
- Recipes with correct formatting: ~40 (29%)
- Recipes with minor formatting issues: ~80 (57%)
- Recipes needing major revision: ~20 (14%)
- Potential duplicates identified: 1 pair

This systematic approach ensures that all recipes will eventually conform to the established standards while maintaining historical accuracy and educational value.
