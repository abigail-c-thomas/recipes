# Recipe System Improvements

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Inconsistent Recipe Transfer**: We found that recipes weren't being copied word-for-word from _recipes_to_add to _recipes
   - Solution: Created a clear workflow with explicit instruction to copy EXACTLY
   - Added tracking to verify recipe text matches original

2. **Missing Original Texts**: Original Latin/Greek texts were often missing even when available
   - Solution: Added workflow step to explicitly search for source texts
   - Fixed affected recipes by adding the missing original texts

3. **Hallucinated Sources**: Sometimes Claude would fabricate source texts when unavailable
   - Solution: Added verification steps to check if source is actually available
   - Created source availability map to clarify which texts are accessible

4. **Incorrect Formatting**: Recipes didn't consistently follow the template
   - Solution: Verification checklist to ensure template adherence
   - Format-specific status code in tracking system

5. **Duplicate Recipes**: Recipes were sometimes created multiple times
   - Solution: Explicit duplicate checking step in workflow
   - Tracking system to log existing recipes

## Implementation Details

1. **Recipe Tracking Database** (_claude_memory/recipe_tracking.md)
   - Table of all recipes with status codes
   - Issues and notes for each recipe
   - Lists of recipes to add and potential duplicates
   - Source text availability map

2. **Recipe Workflow** (_claude_memory/recipe_workflow.md)
   - Step-by-step process for adding/updating recipes
   - Clear instructions for finding originals
   - Formatting requirements
   - Verification checklist

3. **JSON Database** (_claude_memory/recipe_database.json)
   - Machine-readable format
   - Detailed metadata for each recipe
   - Complete status tracking

4. **Example Fixes**
   - Fixed olive-relish by adding missing Latin text and translation
   - Added proper Claude's intro to multiple recipes
   - Updated alexandrian-gourd to match format guidelines
   - Added marked introductions to hipotrimma and apician-ofellae

## Next Steps

1. Continue processing the remaining recipes in _recipes_to_add
2. Update all existing recipes to match the new guidelines
3. Complete the recipe database with all recipe data
4. Consider automation for certain workflow steps
5. Regular audits of recipe completeness and consistency

These improvements provide a structured approach to maintaining recipe quality and preventing the issues previously encountered.
