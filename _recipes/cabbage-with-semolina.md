### Original Latin
*Aliter: culiculis conditis ut supra; superfundes alicam elixam cum nucleis et uua passa super asparges.*

### English Translation
Another way: with cabbage seasoned as above; pour over cooked grain with pine nuts and sprinkle raisins on top.

â€”*Apicius*, 3.9.6, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This elaborate cabbage dish demonstrates the Roman penchant for combining vegetables with grains and fruits to create more substantial and complex dishes. The combination of cabbage with semolina porridge, enriched with pine nuts and raisins, creates a hearty dish that bridges the gap between side and main course. The layered presentation, with the semolina mixture poured over the seasoned cabbage, creates visual interest as well as textural contrast. The sweet and savory elements in this recipe showcase the characteristic Roman approach to flavor combinations that might surprise modern diners.

### Ingredients
- 500g {% include ingredient_link.html name="cabbage" %}, chopped into thin strips
- 4 Tb of {% include ingredient_link.html name="semolina" %}
- 30g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pine nuts" %}
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- 30g {% include ingredient_link.html name="raisins" %}
- A handful of {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} leaves, chopped

### Method
1. Heat 250 ml of water in a small saucepan. Add the semolina, pine nuts, along with a generous pinch of salt. Cook until thick, stirring frequently to prevent sticking.
2. While the semolina is cooking, add the cabbage to a wok or frying pan along with about 100 ml of water. Cook for 5 or so minutes, until the cabbage is tender and the water has evaporated.
3. Add the fish sauce, white wine, olive oil, and cumin to the wok. Cook for a further minute or two until most of the liquid has evaporated.
4. Place the cabbage into a serving dish, and sprinkle with the coriander leaves. Pour over the semolina, then sprinkle on raisins, and serve.

### Notes
- *Alica* was a type of grain preparation similar to modern semolina or farro, made from hulled and cracked emmer wheat.
- The combination of pine nuts and raisins appears frequently in Roman cuisine, adding both texture and sweetness to savory dishes.
- This recipe represents a more complex and substantial preparation compared to the simpler cabbage recipes in Apicius.
- The layered presentation of this dish suggests it may have been served as a more elegant offering than basic boiled vegetables.
