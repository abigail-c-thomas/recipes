# Sweet Pudding

### Original Text
*dulcia piperata: teres piper, mittis mel merum passum rutam, eo mittis nucleos nuces alicam elixatam. concisas nuces auellanas tostas adicies et inferes.*

### English Translation
Peppered sweet dish: Grind pepper, add pure honey, *passum* [raisin wine], and rue. Add pine nuts, walnuts, and boiled *alica* [grain similar to bulgur wheat]. Add chopped toasted hazelnuts and serve.

â€”*Apicius*, 7.11.4, c. 4th century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** This sweet grain-based pudding illustrates the Roman fondness for combining sweet and savory elements. *Alica*, a grain preparation similar to modern bulgur wheat, forms the base of this dessert, while the mixture of different nuts creates interesting textures. The addition of pepper to sweet dishes was common in Roman cuisine and demonstrates their sophisticated approach to flavor combinations. This would have been a luxurious dish, as pine nuts and honey were expensive ingredients, suggesting it might have been served at elaborate banquets rather than as everyday fare.

### Ingredients
- 80g {% include ingredient_link.html name="bulgur wheat" %} (substitute for *alica*)
- 40g {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 2 Tb white {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}
- 2 Tb *passum* (raisin wine, substitute with sweet dessert wine)
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %} (substitute with rosemary if unavailable)
- 30g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pine nuts" %}, crushed
- 30g {% include ingredient_link.html name="walnuts" %}, crushed
- 15g {% include ingredient_link.html name="hazelnuts" %}

### Method
1. Soak the bulgur wheat in warm water for 20 minutes until plump.
2. Drain the bulgur and mix with all the remaining ingredients except the hazelnuts.
3. Toast the hazelnuts in a frying pan for a few minutes. Chop, sprinkle on top of the pudding, and serve.

### Notes
This dish is served at room temperature and has a consistency similar to a thick porridge. The combination of sweet honey with the sharp bite of black pepper may seem unusual to modern tastes but was typical of Roman cuisine. If rue is unavailable, substitute with rosemary or omit entirely.
