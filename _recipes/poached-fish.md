# Poached Fish

### Original Latin
*Aliter ius in pisce elixo: cum curaueris piscem, adicies in sartaginem <piper liquamen coriandri> semen aquam anetum uiridem et ipsum piscem. cum coctus fuerit, asperges aceto et inferes.*

### English Translation
Another sauce for boiled fish: when you have prepared the fish, add to a pan pepper, fish sauce, coriander seed, water, fresh dill, and the fish itself. When it is cooked, sprinkle with vinegar and serve.

—*Apicius*, 10.1.5, c. 4th century CE

### Ingredients
- 400 g white fish fillet
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander seed" %}
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="dill" %} leaf
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 400 ml water
- Red {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}

### Method
1. Choose a frying pan just large enough to fit the pieces of fish. Add the spices, fish sauce, and water to the pan, and bring to a simmer.
2. Add the fish, then reduce the heat so that the water remains below a simmer. Poach the fish until cooked, about 5–10 minutes.
3. Remove the fish from the poaching liquid and serve sprinkled with a little vinegar and pepper.

### Notes
- This gentle poaching method preserves the delicate texture of fish while infusing it with aromatic flavors.
- Any firm white fish like cod, haddock, or sea bass works well in this recipe.
- The final addition of vinegar adds a bright acidity that balances the rich umami from the fish sauce.
- This simple preparation was likely an everyday method of cooking fish in Roman households.
