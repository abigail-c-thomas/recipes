# Poached Fish

### Original Latin
*Aliter ius in pisce elixo: cum curaueris piscem, adicies in sartaginem <piper liquamen coriandri> semen aquam anetum uiridem et ipsum piscem. cum coctus fuerit, asperges aceto et inferes.*

### English Translation
Another sauce for boiled fish: when you have prepared the fish, add to a pan pepper, fish sauce, coriander seed, water, fresh dill, and the fish itself. When it is cooked, sprinkle with vinegar and serve.

—*Apicius*, 10.1.5, c. 4th century CE

___

**Ingredients**

* 400 g white fish fillet  
* ½ tsp ground black pepper  
* 1 tsp coriander seed  
* ½ tsp dried dill leaf  
* 30 ml fish sauce  
* 400 ml water  
* Red vinegar

**Method**

1. Choose a frying pan just large enough to fit the pieces of fish. Add the spices, fish sauce, and water to the pan, and bring to a simmer.  
2. Add the fish, then reduce the heat so that the water remains below a simmer. Poach the fish until cooked, about 5–10 minutes.  
3. Remove the fish from the poaching liquid and serve sprinkled with a little vinegar and pepper.
