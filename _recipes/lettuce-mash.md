___

**Claude's intro:** This unusual preparation of lettuce transforms the typically crisp leaves into a soft, flavorful puree. The Romans often cooked vegetables that we typically eat raw today, and this recipe shows their creativity with common ingredients. The use of baking soda (representing the ancient natron) helps preserve the bright green color, while the mixture of herbs, fish sauce, and wine creates a complex flavor profile typical of Roman cuisine.

### Ingredients
- 1 head of {% include ingredient_link.html name="lettuce" %}  
- 2 {% include ingredient_link.html name="onion" %}s, peeled and cut in half  
- 1 tsp baking soda  
- Black {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}  
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}  
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="celery seed" %}s, ground in mortar and pestle  
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="mint" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- 2 Tbsp white {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}

### Method
1. Place the lettuce, onions, and baking soda in a large saucepan. Cover in water, bring to the boil, and then simmer for 15 minutes.

2. Drain the water from the saucepan, then leave the lettuce and onions to cool for a few minutes.

3. Once cool enough to handle, squeeze as much liquid as you can out of the lettuce and onions, then finely dice and place into a serving bowl.

4. Mix together the pepper, herbs, fish sauce, olive oil, and wine, then pour over puree. Toss the mixture and serve.

### Notes
Recipes 3.15.1 and 3.15.2 give very similar recipes for pureed alexanders and celery, also cooked in soda. Recipe 3.1 simple states that leaf vegetables become emerald green if cooked in soda.

Pliny notes that the Apician method for cooking cabbage is with soda, which helps them retain their colour.

It is unclear if the onion is supposed to be cooked with the cabbage. In the Grainger & Grocock text the onions are cooked, but the other texts bracket the heading differently to imply that the onions are not cooked.
