# Gourd with Thickened Sauce

### Original Latin
*Aliter cucurbitas iure colocesiorum: cucurbitas quoques ex aqua in modum colocasiorum; teres piper cuminum rutam; suffundes acetum, liquamen temperabis in caccabum cui adicies <oleum modicum> et eas cucurbitas incisas expressas; in ius mittes ut ferueant; amulo obligas; piper asparges et inferes.*

### English Translation
"Another way with gourds in the style of colocasia: cook the gourds in water in the manner of colocasia; grind pepper, cumin, and rue; add vinegar, mix with fish sauce in a pot to which you add a little oil and the cut and drained gourds; put them in the sauce to boil; thicken with starch; sprinkle with pepper and serve."

—*Apicius*, 3.4.2, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This recipe is similar to the previous gourd recipe, but with the addition of a thickened sauce. The reference to "colocasia" suggests this method was used for taro root as well. This dish balances the mild flavor of the gourd with a tangy, savory thickened sauce.

### Ingredients
- 500 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="squash" %} (or gourd, if you can find it)  
- ½ tsp ground black {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}  
- 1 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}  
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="water" %}  
- 1½ Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="red wine vinegar" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- ½ Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cornstarch" %}

### Method
1. Cut the squash into large pieces then boil until *al dente*. Remove from the water and place in a dutch oven.

2. Mix together all other ingredients except the cornstarch and pour over the squash. Bring to a simmer and cook for a few minutes.

3. Add the cornstarch mixed with a little water. Thicken for a couple minutes, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

### Notes
This is very similar to the previous recipe, the main differences being the absence of laser (silphium/asafoetida) and the thickening of the sauce.

This is also very similar to *Apicius* 7.15, which is a sauce for taro differing only in the substitution of honey instead of vinegar.
