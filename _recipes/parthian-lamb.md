# Parthian Lamb

### Original Text
*hedum siue agnum Particum: mittes in furnum; teres piper rutam cepam satureiam damascena enucleata laseris modicum uinum liquamen et oleum. feruens colluitur in disco, ex aceto sumitur.*

### English Translation
Parthian-style kid or lamb: Put it in the oven. Grind pepper, rue, onion, savory, pitted damascene plums, a little *laser* (asafoetida), wine, fish sauce, and oil. When hot, wash it over in a dish, and serve with vinegar.

—*Apicius*, 8.6.10, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This recipe takes its name from the ancient Parthian Empire, which was a major political and cultural power to the east of the Roman Empire. The combination of sweet prunes with savory herbs and the distinctive umami of fish sauce creates a complex flavor profile that would have been considered exotic and sophisticated in ancient Rome. This type of dish represents the Roman fondness for incorporating culinary techniques and flavor combinations from conquered territories.

### Ingredients
- 1 kg {% include ingredient_link.html name="lamb" %} roast
- 1 small {% include ingredient_link.html name="onion" %}, pulverised or finely diced
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 300 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="red wine" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 15 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 150 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="prunes" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="savory" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/475°F. Place the lamb roast in the oven and roast until medium rare, about 1 hour. Once cooked, remove from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes before carving into thick slices.
2. When the lamb is almost ready to take out of the oven, start preparing the sauce by heating the olive oil in a saucepan. Then add the onions and fry for 5 minutes, until soft and translucent.
3. Add the remaining ingredients. Bring to a simmer and then cook for 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired.
4. Add the carved meat to the saucepan, along with any meat juices. Mix everything together to cook for a minute, then remove from heat and serve.

### Notes
- This recipe shares its name with the famous Parthian chicken dish, suggesting the popularity of Parthian cuisine in ancient Rome.
- The combination of fruit (prunes) and savory herbs creates a sweet-savory balance characteristic of many ancient Roman dishes.
