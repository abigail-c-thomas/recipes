### Ingredients
- 1 kg {% include ingredient_link.html name="lamb" %} roast
- 1 small {% include ingredient_link.html name="onion" %}, pulverised or finely diced
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 300 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="red wine" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 15 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 150 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="prunes" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="savory" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/475°F. Place the lamb roast in the oven and roast until medium rare, about 1 hour. Once cooked, remove from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes before carving into thick slices.
2. When the lamb is almost ready to take out of the oven, start preparing the sauce by heating the olive oil in a saucepan. Then add the onions and fry for 5 minutes, until soft and translucent.
3. Add the remaining ingredients. Bring to a simmer and then cook for 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired.
4. Add the carved meat to the saucepan, along with any meat juices. Mix everything together to cook for a minute, then remove from heat and serve.

### Notes
- This recipe shares its name with the famous Parthian chicken dish, suggesting the popularity of Parthian cuisine in ancient Rome.
- The combination of fruit (prunes) and savory herbs creates a sweet-savory balance characteristic of many ancient Roman dishes.
