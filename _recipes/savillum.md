# Savillum

### Original Text
From Cato, *De Agricultura* 84:

> Savillum hoc modo facito. Farinae selibram, casei P. II S una conmisceto quasi libum, mellis P. et ovum unum. Catinum fictile oleo unguito. Ubi omnia bene conmiscueris, in catinum indito, catinum testo operito. Videto ut bene percocas medio, ubi altissimum est. Ubi coctum erit, catinum eximito, melle unguito, papaver infriato, sub testum subde paulisper, postea eximito. Ita pone cum catillo et lingula.

"Make savillum thus: Mix half a libra of flour and 2½ pounds of cheese, as if for libum. Add ¼ pound honey and 1 egg. Grease an earthenware bowl with oil. When you have mixed everything well, put it into the bowl and cover the bowl with a lid. Take care that you cook it well in the middle, where it is highest. When it is cooked, remove the bowl, spread with honey, sprinkle with poppy, put it back beneath the lid briefly, then remove. Serve thus with a plate and spoon."

—*Cato*, *De Agricultura* 84, 2nd century BCE

Savillum is one of the earliest recorded cheesecake recipes, appearing in Cato the Elder's agricultural manual. This simple dessert combines fresh cheese with honey and poppy seeds for a sweet treat that's similar to modern cheesecake but with a distinctive Roman flavor profile.

### Ingredients
- 750 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="ricotta" %}  
- 150 g white {% include ingredient_link.html name="flour" %}  
- 75 g of {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}, plus additional for serving  
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="egg" %}  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="poppy seeds" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F.

2. In a mixing bowl, mix together the ricotta, flour, honey, and egg, until well-combined.

3. Grease a deep pie dish or cake pan. Pour the cake batter into the dish, then place in the oven and bake for 60 minutes.

4. Once 60 minutes have passed, checked whether the cake is cooked through by sticking a skewer through the middle — it should come out clean. If not, continue baking until cooked through.

5. Once the cake is cooked, take it out of the oven. Cover it in the honey, sprinkle over poppy seeds, and then place back into the oven for a final 10 minutes. Serve immediately.
