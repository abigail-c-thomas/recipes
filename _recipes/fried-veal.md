**Claude's intro:** This simple yet flavorful veal recipe from Apicius demonstrates the Roman fondness for combining sweet, sour, and savory elements in a single dish. The combination of honey, vinegar, wine, and fish sauce creates a balanced sauce reminiscent of modern sweet-and-sour preparations, while the herbs and spices add aromatic complexity. Unlike many modern Western cooking traditions that separate sweet from savory, Roman cuisine regularly incorporated fruits and sweeteners into meat dishes. This preparation would have been served at the tables of wealthy Romans, as veal was considered a luxury meat in ancient Rome, often featured at elaborate banquets.

### Ingredients
- 500g of thin veal steaks
- 1 onion, finely diced
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="celery seed" %}, crushed in mortar and pestle
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="oregano" %}
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 40g {% include ingredient_link.html name="raisins" %}
- 100 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="red wine" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method
1. Heat olive oil in a skillet. Add the veal and fry for a few minutes, until cooked through. Remove veal from the skillet and set aside.
2. Add the diced onion to the skillet and cook until soft. Then add all of the remaining ingredients to the skillet. Simmer for about 5 minutes, until the sauce has become thick and glossy.
3. Add the veal back into the skillet, reheat for 1 minute, and then serve.

### Notes
- This sweet-savory sauce combination was typical of Roman cuisine and works well with other meats if veal is unavailable.
- *Defrutum* can be substituted with reduced grape juice or a sweet fortified wine like port.
- The original recipe provides only a list of ingredients without specific quantities or cooking instructions, a common pattern in Apicius.
