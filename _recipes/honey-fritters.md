# Honey Fritters

### Original Text
*Aliter dulcia: accipies similam, coques in aquam calidam ita ut durissimam pultem facias, deinde in patellam expandis. cum refrixerit, concidis quasi dulcia et frigis in oleo optimo. leuas, perfundis mel, piper aspargis et inferes. melius feceris, si lac pro aquam miseris.*

### English Translation
"Another sweet: take fine flour, cook in hot water so that you make a very firm porridge, then spread it in a small pan. When it has cooled, cut it like sweets and fry in the best oil. Remove, pour over honey, sprinkle with pepper and serve. You will do better if you use milk instead of water."

â€”*Apicius*, 7.11.6, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** These sweet fritters are a classic Roman dessert, featuring the characteristic combination of honey and black pepper that was popular in ancient Roman sweets. While modern palates might consider pepper an unusual addition to desserts, the Romans appreciated its subtle heat as a contrast to the honey's sweetness.

### Ingredients
- 100g plain {% include ingredient_link.html name="flour" %}  
- 200 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="milk" %}  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}

### Method
1. In a saucepan, whisk together the flour, milk, and 2 Tbsp olive oil. Gently heat while continually stirring, until the mixture thickens into a semisolid mass.

2. Pour the flour mixture onto a plate and spread thinly. Chill in the fridge until the mixture is solid.

3. Heat olive oil in a fry pan or wok. Cut the flour mixture into small fritters, then fry a batch of the fritters until golden brown on both sides. Place on a paper towel to cool while you cook the remaining fritters.

4. Once all the fritters are cooked, serve coated in honey and sprinkled with ground pepper.

### Notes
The suggestion to add olive oil to the plain flour and milk mixture comes from Sally Grainger; it helps firm up the batter.

Could be interesting to try using semolina rather than plain flour.
