# Flaccian Piglet

### Original Latin
**porcellum Flacianum**: porcellum ornas in modum apri, sale asperges et in furnum mittes. dum coquitur adicies in mortarium piper ligusticum careum apii semen laseris radicem rutam uiridem, fricabis; suffundes liquamen, uino et passo temperabis, in caccabum; cum olei modicum ferueat; amulo obligas. porcellum coctum ab ossibus tanges, apii semen teres ita ut fiat puluis, asperges et inferes.

### English Translation
**Flaccian piglet**: Prepare the piglet in the manner of a boar, sprinkle with salt and put in the oven. While it is cooking, add to a mortar pepper, lovage, caraway, celery seed, asafoetida root, fresh rue, and grind; moisten with fish sauce, mix with wine and *passum*, [put] in a pot; when a little oil becomes hot, thicken with starch. Remove the cooked piglet from the bones, grind celery seed to make a powder, sprinkle and serve.

—*Apicius*, 8.7.8, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This recipe is named after a person called Flaccus, though we don't know exactly which Flaccus is being referenced. It could refer to one of several prominent Romans with this name, such as Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) or another member of the Flaccus family. The recipe is part of a series of named piglet dishes in Apicius, each with its own sauce and preparation method. The instruction to prepare it "in the manner of a boar" suggests this was a way to give humble pork the appearance of more prestigious wild game meat, a common practice in high-status Roman cookery.

### Ingredients
- 1 kg meat from {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} shoulder
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %} leaf
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="caraway" %} seed, ground
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="celery seed" %}, ground
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- 40 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 100 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}
- 100 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="passum" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 1 Tb cornstarch, made into a slurry

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 325°F / 160°C. Generously salt the meat and then roast for 1.5 hours, or until cooked through. Take out to rest while you prepare the sauce.
2. Add all of the remaining ingredients, barring only the starch and half the celery seed, to a saucepan. Bring to the boil then simmer for 5 minutes.
3. Add the cornstarch slurry and continue to cook until thickened. Place the meat on a serving dish and pour the sauce over, then sprinkle on the remaining celery seed and serve.

### Notes
- To make *Apicius* 8.7.7, Vitellian piglet, simply omit the caraway, celery seed, asafoetida, and rue.
- To make *Apicius* 8.7.9, piglet in bay sauce, slice the pork horizontally almost in half and place a few bay leaves in the cavity. Then prepare the above sauce, simply replacing the rue with a pounded bay berry.
