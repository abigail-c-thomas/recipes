### Ingredients
- 1 kg meat from {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} shoulder
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %} leaf
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="caraway" %} seed, ground
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="celery seed" %}, ground
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- 40 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 100 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}
- 100 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="passum" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 1 Tb cornstarch, made into a slurry

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 325°F / 160°C. Generously salt the meat and then roast for 1.5 hours, or until cooked through. Take out to rest while you prepare the sauce.
2. Add all of the remaining ingredients, barring only the starch and half the celery seed, to a saucepan. Bring to the boil then simmer for 5 minutes.
3. Add the cornstarch slurry and continue to cook until thickened. Place the meat on a serving dish and pour the sauce over, then sprinkle on the remaining celery seed and serve.

### Notes
- To make *Apicius* 8.7.7, Vitellian piglet, simply omit the caraway, celery seed, asafoetida, and rue.
- To make *Apicius* 8.7.9, piglet in bay sauce, slice the pork horizontally almost in half and place a few bay leaves in the cavity. Then prepare the above sauce, simply replacing the rue with a pounded bay berry.
