# Egg and Milk Sponge

### Original Text
*oua sfongia ex lacte: oua quattuor, lactis eminam, olei unciam in se dissoluis, ita ut unum corpus facias. in patellam subtilem adicies olei modicum; facies ut bulliat, et adicies inpensam quam comparasti. una parte cum fuerit coctum, in disco uertes, melle perfundis, piper adspargis et inferes.*

### English Translation
Egg sponge with milk: Dissolve together four eggs, a hemina [~250ml] of milk, and an ounce of oil to make a uniform mixture. Add a little oil to a shallow pan; bring it to a boil, and add the prepared mixture. When one side is cooked, turn it onto a plate, drizzle with honey, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

â€”*Apicius*, 7.11.8, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This Roman dish is something between a modern pancake and a frittata, with a sweet-savory flavor profile typical of ancient cuisine. The *oua sfongia* (egg sponge) was a popular preparation that showcased the Roman love of contrasting flavors, combining sweet honey with the sharp bite of black pepper. Unlike many other Roman egg dishes that were baked in ceramic vessels, this one is cooked quickly in a pan, making it a practical dish that has similarities to preparations still found in Mediterranean cuisine today.

### Ingredients
- 4 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}
- 270 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="milk" %}
- 2 Tb olive oil (plus extra for cooking)
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}

### Method
1. Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl along with the milk and olive oil, and whisk until smooth.
2. Place a little additional olive oil into a large frying pan. Heat at maximum flame until it sizzles, then pour in the egg mixture. Let the mixture cook, undisturbed, until the bottom is well done and the top has mostly set.
3. Place the sponge onto a serving plate. Drizzle with the honey, sprinkle on a generous grinding of black pepper, and serve.

### Notes
The combination of honey and black pepper may seem unusual to modern tastes, but was common in Roman cuisine, which often combined sweet and savory elements. The dish is similar to a simple omelet or frittata but with a sweet finish.
