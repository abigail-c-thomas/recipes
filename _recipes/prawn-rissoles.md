# Prawn Rissoles with Sauce for After Bathing

### Original Text
**esicia de iscillis uel de cammaris amplis**: cammari uel iscille de testa sua eximuntur et in mortario teruntur cum pipere et liquamine optimo. pulpe esicia plassantur.

**esicia amulata a balineo sic facies**: teres piper ligusticum origanum modicum silfi gingber minimum mellis modicum; liquamine temperabis; misces adicies super esicia; facies ut ferueat. cum bene bulliuerit amulo obligas ispis so et soruendum inferes.

### English Translation
**Rissoles of shrimp or large prawns**: Prawns or shrimp are removed from their shells and ground in a mortar with pepper and the best fish sauce. Form the meat into rissoles.

**Starchy sauce for rissoles after bathing**: Grind pepper, lovage, oregano, a little asafoetida, a small amount of ginger, a little honey; mix with fish sauce; combine and add over the rissoles; bring to a boil. When it has boiled well, thicken with starch and serve for drinking.

—*Apicius*, 2.1.3 and 2.2.7, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** The Roman bath (thermae) was not just a place for washing but a central social institution where Romans would spend hours exercising, relaxing, and socializing. After bathing, Romans often consumed special foods and drinks designed to revitalize the body. This recipe comes from that tradition - the warming sauce was meant to be consumed after visiting the baths, perhaps to replenish energy and warm the body. The sauce is described as "sorvendus" (for drinking/sipping), suggesting it might have been consumed as a restorative drink with the rissoles, or perhaps poured over them as a thick sauce. Apicius includes several recipes specifically marked as appropriate "a balineo" (after bathing).

### Ingredients
*For meatballs*
- 500g {% include ingredient_link.html name="prawns" %}, minced
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- Pinch ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="white pepper" %}

*For sauce*
- Generous ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}

- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="ginger" %}
- Pinch of {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 300 ml water
- 1½ Tb starch, made into a slurry

### Method
1. Make the prawn rissoles by mixing the minced prawns with the fish sauce and white pepper, and roll them into small balls.
2. Place all the ingredients for the sauce in a pan, except for the starch. Mix together and bring to a simmer. Add the prawn rissole, and simmer for about 5 minutes, or until the rissoles are fully cooked.
3. Add the starch slurry to the sauce. Cook until thickened, then serve.
