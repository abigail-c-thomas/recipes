# Cabbage with Leek

### Original Latin
*Aliter: cauliculi elixati in patina conpositi condiuntur liquamine oleo mero; cui mittis ciminum minutum et piper satis ut dulce sit. ferbeat in caccabo, positis caulicula, quo ius praecedat. cum bene ferbuerit, ius facies piper tritum ciminum minutim uel silfi modicum, suffundes merum et liquamen temperabis in eo. mittis in caccabum supra cauliculos quos agitabis ut ad ius perveniant. cum bene temperaveris, tollis.*

### English Translation
Another way: boiled cabbage sprouts arranged in a dish are seasoned with fish sauce, oil, and wine; to which you add ground cumin and enough pepper to make it sweet. Let it boil in a pot with the cabbage arranged so that the broth covers it. When it has boiled well, make a sauce of ground pepper, finely chopped cumin or a little silphium, moisten with wine and mix with fish sauce. Put in the pot over the cabbage which you will agitate so that they absorb the broth. When well mixed, remove.

—*Apicius*, 3.9.3, c. 4th century CE

This braised cabbage dish showcases a more complex preparation than the previous cabbage recipes, with a longer cooking time that allows the flavors to meld beautifully. The initial quick frying of the cabbage and leek provides a foundation of flavor, while the slow braising in a sauce of wine, fish sauce, and spices transforms the humble vegetables into a rich, savory dish. The oven-braising method used in this adaptation allows for even cooking and flavor development. This substantial vegetable preparation could have served as a side dish to meat in a Roman meal, or as a standalone course for a simpler repast.

### Ingredients
- 500g {% include ingredient_link.html name="cabbage" %}
- 1 small {% include ingredient_link.html name="leek" %}, finely chopped
- 80 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- A handful of {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} leaf, chopped
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 250 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="water" %}

### Method
1. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.
2. Chop the cabbage and leek into large strips. Add to a large dutch oven along with the olive oil, and fry on high heat until the cabbage begins to brown.
3. Add the remaining ingredients to the dutch oven, stir, and bring to a simmer. 
4. Put on the lid and place in the oven. Cook covered for 45 minutes, then remove the lid and cook uncovered for another 25 minutes.
5. Remove from the oven and serve.

### Notes
- The extended cooking time allows the cabbage to become very tender and absorb the flavors of the sauce.
- The original recipe includes detailed instructions on how to ensure the cabbage absorbs the broth properly.
- This dish represents a more complex approach to vegetable cookery than the simpler cabbage preparations in Apicius.
- The translation of "ut dulce sit" as "to make it sweet" is interesting - while pepper isn't sweet to modern tastes, the Romans may have perceived certain spices differently, or this could refer to a pleasant rather than literally sweet flavor.
