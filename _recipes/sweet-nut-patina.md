**Claude's intro:** This unusual dessert exemplifies the Roman fondness for sweet-savory combinations. The *patina versatilis* (versatile dish) could be adapted to various ingredients, and here we have two similar versions using nuts. What may surprise modern diners is the inclusion of fish sauce (*liquamen*) in what is essentially a sweet dish, but this was typical of Roman cuisine which didn't maintain strict boundaries between sweet and savory flavors. The dish is similar to a modern frittata in preparation but with a flavor profile distinctly ancient.

### Ingredients
- 40g mixture of {% include ingredient_link.html name="hazelnuts" %}, {% include ingredient_link.html name="almonds" %}, and/or {% include ingredient_link.html name="walnuts" %}
- 20g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pine nuts" %}
- Generous ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}
- 3 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}
- 60ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="milk" %}
- 10ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 10ml olive oil
- 15ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}, plus extra for serving

### Method
1. Place the nuts into a frying pan and toast for a few minutes. Tip into a mortar and pestle and grind into a coarse powder.
2. Place the remaining ingredients into a mixing bowl and whisk until smooth.
3. Pour the egg mixture into the frying pan along with the nuts, and cook gently. Flip or finish under the broiler to cook the top. Serve with additional drizzled honey.

### Notes
The combination of honey, fish sauce, and pepper may seem unusual to modern tastes, but was typical of Roman cuisine. The fish sauce adds a savory depth and saltiness that balances the sweetness of the honey, much as salt is used in modern desserts. This dish can be served either as a dessert or as a sweet appetizer.
