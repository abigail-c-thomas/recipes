# Carthaginian Porridge

### Original Latin
*Pultem Punicam sic coquito. Libram alicae in aquam indito, facito uti bene madeat. Id infundito in alveum purum, eo casei recentis P. III, mellis P. S, ovum unum, omnia una permisceto bene. Ita insipito in aulam novam.*

### English Translation
"Cook Punic porridge thus: put a pound of spelt into water; make it soak well. Pour it into a clean bowl, add three pounds of fresh cheese, half a pound of honey, and one egg; mix all together well. Turn into a new pot."

â€”*Cato*, *De Agricultura* 85, c. 2nd century BCE

___

**Claude's intro:** This simple but nourishing porridge reveals the influence of Carthaginian cuisine on Roman cooking. Cato the Elder, who famously ended every Senate speech with "Carthage must be destroyed," ironically preserved this Carthaginian recipe in his agricultural manual.

### Ingredients
- 100 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="bulgur wheat" %} or {% include ingredient_link.html name="cracked wheat" %}  
- 300 g fresh {% include ingredient_link.html name="cheese" %}, such as ricotta or cottage cheese  
- 50 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="egg" %}

### Method
Place the wheat in a saucepan and cover with water. Soak for 10 minutes, then drain any excess liquid. Add the remaining ingredients and whisk together. Place on medium heat and stir constantly until it reaches a porridge-like consistency.
