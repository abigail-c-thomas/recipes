# Cabbages with Herbs

### Original Latin
*Coliculos: elixatos, expressos, in patina conpones. adicies oleum, liquamen, uinum. concides porrum, coriandrum, satureiam, suffundes ius.*

### English Translation
For cabbage sprouts: boil them, squeeze out the water, and arrange in a dish. Add oil, fish sauce, and wine. Chop leek, coriander, and savory, and pour over the broth.

—*Apicius*, 3.9.1a, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This simple preparation of cabbage highlights the Roman appreciation for vegetables enhanced with herbs and savory liquids. The method of first boiling and then seasoning the cabbage preserves its texture while allowing it to absorb the flavorful dressing. The combination of aromatic herbs adds complexity to what might otherwise be a plain vegetable dish. This recipe exemplifies the Roman approach to vegetable cookery: straightforward techniques combined with layers of flavor from herbs, wine, and their ubiquitous fish sauce.

### Ingredients
- 300g {% include ingredient_link.html name="cabbage" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="mint" %}
- A small handful of {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} leaf, chopped
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method
1. Chop the cabbage into thin strips. Boil with water in a saucepan for 5-7 minutes, or until tender.
2. Drain the water from the saucepan, then add the remaining ingredients.
3. Return the saucepan to the heat for a couple minutes while mixing everything together, then serve.

### Notes
- The original recipe calls for cabbage sprouts or shoots, but regular cabbage works well as a modern substitute.
- The instruction to "squeeze out the water" after boiling was an important step to prevent the dish from becoming watery.
- This basic preparation of cabbage appears with several variations throughout Apicius, indicating it was a common dish in Roman households.
- The combination of wine and fish sauce created a savory broth that was characteristic of many Roman vegetable dishes.
