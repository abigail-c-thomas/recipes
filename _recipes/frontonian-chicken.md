# Frontonian Chicken

### Original Latin
*Pullum Frontonianum: pullum praedura, condies liquamine oleo mixto, cui mittis fasciculum aneti porri satureiae et coriandri uiridis, et quoques. ut coctus fuerit leuabis eum, in lance defrito perungues, piper aspargis et inferes.*

### English Translation
Frontonian chicken: Partially cook the chicken in a mixture of fish sauce and oil, to which you add a bundle of dill, leek, savory, and fresh coriander, and cook it. When it is cooked, remove it, brush it with *defrutum* on a serving dish, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

—*Apicius*, 6.8.12, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This simple yet flavorful chicken dish represents the Roman practice of naming recipes after individuals - in this case likely Fronto, a Roman author or notable figure. The recipe demonstrates the Roman technique of cooking meat in a fragrant herb bundle, then finishing with a contrasting sweet element. The process creates chicken with complex flavor despite the straightforward preparation. The final touch of *defrutum* (reduced grape must) adds a glossy, sweet finish that balances the savory aspects of the dish, while the fresh herbs infuse the meat during cooking without overwhelming it.

### Ingredients
- 1 kg {% include ingredient_link.html name="chicken" %} thighs, with skin and bone
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="leek" %}, sliced in half
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="dill" %} leaf
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="savory" %}
- 1 small handful {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} leaf
- 120 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Place a large dutch oven on high heat. Place the chicken skin side down, and fry until the skin is golden. Flip and brown on the meat side.
2. Add the olive oil, fish sauce, leek, and herbs, along with 100 ml of water. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
3. Remove the chicken from the cooking liquor. Plate each thigh with just a little of the cooking liquor. Drizzle on a tablespoon or so of *defrutum*, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

### Notes
- The broth and leek are not typically eaten in the final dish, though they impart significant flavor to the chicken during cooking.
- The Fronto referred to is likely the same author who wrote sections of *The Geoponica*, possibly Sextus Julius Frontinus (c. 40–103), a Roman senator and consul known for his treatise on aqueducts.
- This recipe demonstrates the Roman technique of cooking with herb bundles, similar to the modern bouquet garni.
- The *defrutum* can be substituted with reduced balsamic vinegar or pomegranate molasses for a similar sweet-tart finish.
