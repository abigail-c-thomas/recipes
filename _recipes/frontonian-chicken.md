# Frontonian Chicken

### Original Text
*Pullum Frontonianum: pullum praedura, condies liquamine oleo mixto, cui mittis fasciculum aneti porri satureiae et coriandri uiridis, et quoques. u coctus fuerit leuabis eum, in lance defrito perungues, piper aspargis et inferes.*

Frontonian chicken: Partially cook the chicken in a mixture of fish sauce and oil, to which you add a bundle of dill, leek, savory, and fresh coriander, and cook it. When it is cooked, remove it, brush it with reduced grape must on a serving dish, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

—*Apicius*, 6.8.12, c. 4th century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** This simple yet flavorful chicken dish is named after a person named Fronto. The chicken is gently simmered with aromatic herbs, then finished with a sweet drizzle of reduced grape juice and a sprinkle of pepper.

### Ingredients
- 1 kg chicken thighs, with skin and bone
- 2 Tb olive oil
- 2 Tb fish sauce
- 1 leek, sliced in half
- 1 tsp dill leaf
- ½ tsp dried savory
- 1 small handful coriander leaf
- 120 ml *defrutum*
- Pepper

### Method
1. Place a large dutch oven on high heat. Place the chicken skin side down, and fry until the skin is golden. Flip and brown on the meat side.
2. Add the olive oil, fish sauce, leek, and herbs, along with 100 ml of water. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
3. Remove the chicken from the cooking liquor. Plate each thigh with just a little of the cooking liquor. Drizzle on a tablespoon or so of *defrutum*, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

### Notes
The broth and leek are not eaten, probably because they look unappetizing, but they taste really good.

The Fronto referred to is likely the same author who wrote sections 7.12, 7.22, and 19.2 of *The Geoponica*. Plausibly this "Fronto" is Sextus Julius Frontinus (c. 40 – 103), a Roman senator and consul known chiefly now for having written a treatise on aqueducts.
