**Claude's intro:** This simple preparation of carrots showcases the Roman fondness for cumin as a spice. The addition of wine and fish sauce creates a savory glaze that enhances the natural sweetness of the carrots.

### Ingredients
- 4 {% include ingredient_link.html name="carrot" %}s, chopped in bite-sized pieces  
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}  
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- 90 ml white {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}  
- 15 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}

### Method
1. Place the carrots in a frying pan and cover with water. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the carrots are soft.

2. Drain the frying pan and then return the carrots to the frying pan. Add the remaining ingredients, fry until the wine is reduced, and serve.
