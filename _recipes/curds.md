**Claude's intro:** Fresh cheese and curds (*melcae*) were common everyday foods in ancient Rome. They were made by curdling milk with rennet or vegetable juices, then straining the curds. Unlike modern cheeses, Roman fresh cheeses were typically consumed soon after preparation without aging. They were considered cooling foods, appropriate for summer meals, and were enjoyed both on their own with simple seasonings as shown in this recipe, and as ingredients in more complex dishes like *patinae* (egg custards) and sweet treats.
