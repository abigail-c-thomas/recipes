# Columella's Oxyporium

—*Columella*, De Re Rustica 12.59e, c. 1st century CE

___

This version of *oxyporium* comes from Columella's agricultural treatise rather than Apicius' cookbook. Columella was a prominent Roman writer on agriculture who lived in the 1st century CE. His version of this digestive sauce shows how medicinal preparations crossed over into culinary use. Like the Apician version, this sauce was likely used both as a medicinal preparation and a condiment, particularly with vegetables like lettuce that were considered potentially difficult to digest. The addition of cheese gives this version a unique savory character not found in other *oxyporium* recipes.

### Ingredients
- 1 tsp white {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="celery seed" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %} (laser root)
- 1 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="parmesan" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}

### Method
1. Mix all the ingredients together thoroughly.
2. Serve with lettuce as a salad dressing, or consume alongside lettuce by the teaspoon.

### Notes
- The use of parmesan cheese (or a similar hard cheese) is unusual in Roman sauces and sets this recipe apart from other versions of *oxyporium*.
- This preparation, like other versions of *oxyporium*, was considered medicinal as well as culinary—the Romans believed such potent, aromatic mixtures aided digestion.
- Columella was primarily concerned with agricultural matters, so his inclusion of this recipe suggests it was considered important for the well-being of a household or farm.
- The original measurements would have been in Roman units; these have been converted to approximate modern equivalents.
