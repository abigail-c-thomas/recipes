**Claude's intro:** This Roman recipe showcases a sweet-savory flavor combination that was popular in ancient Roman cuisine. The dish brings together the earthy taste of fava beans with the pungency of mustard, sweetness of honey, and aromatic herbs. Pine nuts add richness and texture to this simple but flavorful legume dish.

### Ingredients

### Notes
- This simple recipe demonstrates how Romans would enhance everyday legumes with complex flavors.
- Rue is an herb with a bitter taste that was commonly used in Roman cooking but is less common today. If unavailable, substitute with a small amount of rosemary.
- The combination of honey and mustard creates a sweet-savory profile that balances the earthiness of the beans.
- Pine nuts were a luxury ingredient in Roman cooking, often used to add richness to vegetable dishes.
