### Ingredients
*For meatballs*
- 1 kg {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} mince
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

*For hydrogarum*
- 45 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1½ tsp dried Spanish {% include ingredient_link.html name="camomile" %}
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- Generous ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Mix the meatball ingredients together, then form into small balls.
2. Place the *hydrogarum* ingredients into a large saucepan along with 800 ml of water. Bring to a simmer, then add the meatballs. Poach for around 10 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through, then serve the meatballs with the *hydrogarum*.

### Notes
- Apicius 2.2.1 calls for the meatballs to be stuffed with fried pheasant fat. I haven't tried this versions, but it also gives one of the only *isicia* recipe for meat, rather than seafood
