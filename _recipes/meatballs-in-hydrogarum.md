# Meatballs in *Hydrogarum*

### Original Text
***esicia plena**: accipies adipes fasiani recentes, preduras et facis ex eo tessellas. cum pipere liquamine caroeno in esicio includes; et idrogaro quoques et inferes.*

***idrogarata esicia sic facies**: teres piper ligusticum piretrum minimum. suffundes liquamen, temperas aquam cisterninam. dum inducet exinanies in caccabo, et cum esicia ad uaporem ignis pones et caleat et sic sorbendum inferes.*

**Stuffed meatballs**: Take fresh pheasant fat, harden it and cut it into small cubes. With pepper, fish sauce, and *defrutum*, enclose it in a meatball; and cook in fish sauce and water broth and serve.

**How to make meatballs in hydrogarum**: Grind pepper, lovage, and a small amount of pyrethrum. Pour in fish sauce, mix with cistern water. While it's simmering, pour it into a pot, and place the meatballs in it over the heat of the fire so they become warm, and serve it as a broth.

—*Apicius*, 2.2.1/2, c. 350

### Ingredients
*For meatballs*
- 1 kg {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} mince
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

*For hydrogarum*
- 45 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1½ tsp dried Spanish {% include ingredient_link.html name="camomile" %}
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- Generous ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Mix the meatball ingredients together, then form into small balls.
2. Place the *hydrogarum* ingredients into a large saucepan along with 800 ml of water. Bring to a simmer, then add the meatballs. Poach for around 10 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through, then serve the meatballs with the *hydrogarum*.

### Notes
- Apicius 2.2.1 calls for the meatballs to be stuffed with fried pheasant fat. I haven't tried this versions, but it also gives one of the only *isicia* recipe for meat, rather than seafood
