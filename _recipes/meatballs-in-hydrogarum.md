# Meatballs in *Hydrogarum*

### Original Text
***esicia plena**: accipies adipes fasiani recentes, preduras et facis ex eo tessellas. cum pipere liquamine caroeno in esicio includes; et idrogaro quoques et inferes.*

***idrogarata esicia sic facies**: teres piper ligusticum piretrum minimum. suffundes liquamen, temperas aquam cisterninam. dum inducet exinanies in caccabo, et cum esicia ad uaporem ignis pones et caleat et sic sorbendum inferes.*

### English Translation
**Stuffed meatballs**: Take fresh pheasant fat, harden it and cut it into small cubes. With pepper, fish sauce, and *defrutum*, enclose it in a meatball; and cook in fish sauce and water broth and serve.

**How to make meatballs in hydrogarum**: Grind pepper, lovage, and a small amount of pyrethrum. Pour in fish sauce, mix with cistern water. While it's simmering, pour it into a pot, and place the meatballs in it over the heat of the fire so they become warm, and serve it as a broth.

—*Apicius*, 2.2.1/2, c. 4th century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** This recipe showcases two important elements of Roman cuisine: *isicia* (meatballs or forcemeat) and *hydrogarum* (a broth made with the ubiquitous fish sauce known as *garum* or *liquamen*). Roman cooks frequently used meatballs in their cooking, often stuffing them with various ingredients as seen in this recipe. The *hydrogarum* broth, a mixture of water and fish sauce enhanced with herbs and spices, served as both a cooking medium and a flavorful sauce. These dishes represent the sophisticated approach to meat preparation in Roman haute cuisine, where texture, flavor combinations, and aromatic seasonings were carefully considered. The original recipe calls for pheasant fat, indicating this was likely a dish for the wealthy, though the adaptation with pork makes it more accessible for modern cooks.

### Ingredients
*For meatballs*
- 1 kg {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} mince
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

*For hydrogarum*
- 45 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1½ tsp dried Spanish {% include ingredient_link.html name="camomile" %}
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- Generous ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Mix the meatball ingredients together, then form into small balls.
2. Place the *hydrogarum* ingredients into a large saucepan along with 800 ml of water. Bring to a simmer, then add the meatballs. Poach for around 10 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through, then serve the meatballs with the *hydrogarum*.

### Notes
- Apicius 2.2.1 calls for the meatballs to be stuffed with fried pheasant fat. I haven't tried this versions, but it also gives one of the only *isicia* recipe for meat, rather than seafood
