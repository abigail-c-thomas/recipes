# Lentils with Chard

### Original Source
This recipe comes from Galen's treatise "On the Powers of Food" (De Alimentorum Facultatibus), where he discusses the nutritional and medicinal properties of various foods, including lentils combined with vegetables.

â€”*Galen*, On the Powers of Food, R1, c. 2nd century CE

**Claude's intro:** This simple recipe showcases the medical approach to food that Galen, the famous Greek physician to Roman emperors, advocated. Galen was interested in the health properties of food combinations, and this dish exemplifies his approach to balanced nutrition. Lentils were considered drying and earthy, while chard added moisture and provided nutritional balance. The addition of fish sauce (*garum*) and olive oil enriched the dish both in flavor and nutritional value according to ancient medical theory.

### Ingredients
- 300g red {% include ingredient_link.html name="lentils" %}
- 300g {% include ingredient_link.html name="chard" %}, chopped
- 30ml olive oil
- 30ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}

### Method
1. Bring 900ml of water to a boil. Add the lentils, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook uncovered for 15 minutes.
2. Add the chopped chard, then continue to cook uncovered for another 15 minutes, or until both lentils and chard are cooked, adding more water if needed.
3. Add the olive oil and fish sauce. Taste, adjust seasonings if desired, then serve.

### Notes
Galen was particularly interested in the medicinal properties of foods, and would have prescribed this dish for its balanced qualities. Lentils were considered to produce "melancholic humors" but when balanced with greens and proper seasonings, they became a healthful dish suitable for most constitutions. This represents a pragmatic daily meal rather than a luxurious feast dish.
