# Semolina Pudding

### Original Text
*apotermum sic facies: alicam elixa cum nucleis et amindalis depilatis et in aqua infusis et lotis ex creta argentaria ut ad candorem pariter perducantur; cui iam miscebis uuam passam carenum uel passum; desuper piper confractum asparges et in uolitari inferes.*

### English Translation
This is how to make *apotermum*: Boil *alica* [grain similar to semolina] with pine nuts and peeled almonds that have been soaked in water and washed with silver clay so they all become equally white. Mix in raisins and *carenum* or *passum* [reduced or raisin wine]. Sprinkle crushed pepper on top and serve in a small dish.

â€”*Apicius*, 2.2.10, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This simple Roman dessert showcases the sophisticated Roman approach to combining grains, nuts, and sweeteners. *Alica* was a type of grain preparation similar to modern semolina, which forms the base of this creamy pudding. The Romans took great care in the presentation of their food, as evidenced by the specific instructions to whiten the almonds with "silver clay" (likely a type of white clay used for cleaning). The contrasting sweet and peppery flavors would have delighted Roman diners, who enjoyed such flavor combinations in their desserts.

### Ingredients
- 250 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="milk" %}
- 2 heaped tablespoons {% include ingredient_link.html name="semolina" %} flour
- 25g blanched {% include ingredient_link.html name="almonds" %}
- 25g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pine nuts" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}, plus extra for serving
- 60ml *passum* (raisin wine, substitute with sweet dessert wine or grape juice)
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}

### Method
1. Heat the milk and semolina in a small saucepan, stirring constantly until the mixture begins to thicken.
2. Add the nuts, honey, and *passum*. Continue cooking gently for another few minutes, stirring constantly.
3. Transfer the pudding into a serving dish, or small ramekins. Pour additional honey over the top, and then sprinkle with ground pepper. 
4. Place in a refrigerator and serve chilled.

### Notes
This Roman dessert is similar to modern semolina pudding but with additions that might seem unusual to modern tastes. The original recipe calls for the use of *creta argentaria* ("silver clay") to whiten the almonds, a step we've omitted. The combination of sweet honey with the sharp bite of black pepper was typical of Roman cuisine, which often combined flavors in ways unfamiliar to modern palates.
