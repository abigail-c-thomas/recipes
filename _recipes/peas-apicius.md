# Apicius Peas

## Roman Dish from *Apicius*
*Apicius 5.3.6*

### Ingredients
- 250g split {% include ingredient_link.html name="peas" %}  
- 1Â½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}  
- 1 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="celery seed" %}  
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- 3 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}  
- Freshly ground black pepper

### Method

1. Place peas in a saucepan along with 750 ml of water. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for about 1 hour, or until the peas are mushy and thick.  

2. Add the remaining ingredients to the saucepan. Stir, make adjustments to the flavour as needed. Serve with a generous grinding of black pepper.

### Notes
This is a simple but flavorful pea dish from Apicius, a Roman cookbook compiled in the late 4th or early 5th century CE. The combination of herbs and spices (cumin, celery seed, and rue) with sweet (honey and reduced wine) and savory elements (fish sauce) creates a complex flavor profile typical of Roman cuisine.

### Original Text Text

### Translation
"Another recipe for peas or beans: When they have been skimmed, grind honey, fish sauce, reduced wine, cumin, rue, celery seed, oil, and wine. You will pound them. Serve with ground pepper and dumplings."
