**Claude's intro:** This simple but flavorful pea dish from Apicius showcases the Roman approach to legumes, which were dietary staples across all social classes. The combination of aromatic herbs and spices with sweet and savory elements creates a complex flavor profile that elevates humble peas into something more sophisticated. The addition of fish sauce (garum) provides umami depth while honey and reduced wine (defrutum) add sweetness to balance the earthiness of the legumes. This dish demonstrates how Romans transformed basic ingredients with layers of flavor through their characteristic sweet-savory-aromatic combinations.

### Ingredients
- 250g split {% include ingredient_link.html name="peas" %}  
- 1½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}  
- 1 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="celery seed" %}  
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}

- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- 3 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}  
- Freshly ground black pepper

### Method

1. Place peas in a saucepan along with 750 ml of water. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for about 1 hour, or until the peas are mushy and thick.  

2. Add the remaining ingredients to the saucepan. Stir, make adjustments to the flavour as needed. Serve with a generous grinding of black pepper.

### Notes
This is a simple but flavorful pea dish from Apicius, a Roman cookbook compiled in the late 4th or early 5th century CE. The combination of herbs and spices (cumin, celery seed, and rue) with sweet (honey and reduced wine) and savory elements (fish sauce) creates a complex flavor profile typical of Roman cuisine.
