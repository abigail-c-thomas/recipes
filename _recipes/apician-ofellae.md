# Apician *Ofellae*

### Original Text
***ofellas Apicianas**: ofellas exossas, in rotundum conplicas, surclas, ad furnum admoues. postea preduras, leuas; ut humorem exspuant in graticula igni lento exsiccabis ita ne urantur. teres piper ligusticum ciperis cuminum; liquamen et passo temperabis. cum hoc iure ouellas in caccabum mittis. cum coctæ fuerint, leuas et siccas sine iure, piper asperso et inferes. si pingues fuerint, cum surclas, tollis cutem. potest et de abdomine huiusmodi ofellas facere.*

**Apician ofellae**: Bone the ofellae, roll them into a round shape, skewer them, and place them in the oven. When partly cooked, take them out; to remove their moisture, dry them on a grill over a slow fire so they don't burn. Grind pepper, lovage, tiger nuts, and cumin; mix with fish sauce and *passum*. Put the ofellae in a pot with this sauce. When they are cooked, remove them and drain off the sauce, sprinkle with pepper and serve. If they are fatty, when you skewer them, remove the skin. You can also make this kind of ofellae from belly meat.

—*Apicius*, 7.4.2, c. 350

___

**Claude's intro:** These Apician *ofellae* are named after Apicius, the famous Roman gourmand, suggesting they were considered a refined version of this popular meat dish. *Ofellae* were typically small cuts of meat prepared through a combination of roasting and then braising in sauce. This particular preparation highlights the Roman fondness for complex, layered flavors - the initial roasting develops rich meat flavors, while the aromatic sauce featuring fish sauce (garum), tiger nuts, and herbs adds depth. The dish represents the sophisticated meat cookery of wealthy Roman households where exotic ingredients like tiger nuts would have been a sign of affluence and culinary knowledge.

### Ingredients
- 750g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} belly
- 150ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="passum" %}
- 45ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 8 {% include ingredient_link.html name="tiger nuts" %}, crushed
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 200C. Roast the pork belly in the oven until well done, about 1 hr. Once pork belly is cooked, remove from the oven and slice into 3cm x 3cm chunks.
2. Place the pork along with the remaining ingredients into a saucepan. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking until the sauce has mostly evaporated, and clings to the meat. Remove the meat from the saucepan, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

### Notes
- Tiger nuts don't have any close substitutes. Almonds are probably the closest substitute — I would suggest using 2 tsp almond meal. Sally Grainger suggests 1 tsp ground ginger, which results in a pleasant taste but to my palate one that is fairly different from using tiger nuts.
- This recipe appears to be a fairly "typical" form of *ofellae*: the meat is first roasted or boiled, then separate "fried" and served in an *oenogarum*. Apicius 7.4.5 and Vinidarius 4 give generic instructions of this form, but ingredients for the *oenogarum* are not specified. One could simply omit the tiger nuts (and, optionally, cumin) to recreate these more "generic" *ofellae* recipes.
