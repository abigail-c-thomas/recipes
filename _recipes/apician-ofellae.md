# Apician *Ofellae*

### Original Text

—*Apicius*, 7.4.2, c. 350

<!-- TODO: Add description paragraph about this specific style of ofellae -->

### Ingredients
- 750g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} belly
- 150ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="passum" %}
- 45ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 8 {% include ingredient_link.html name="tiger nuts" %}, crushed
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 200C. Roast the pork belly in the oven until well done, about 1 hr. Once pork belly is cooked, remove from the oven and slice into 3cm x 3cm chunks.
2. Place the pork along with the remaining ingredients into a saucepan. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking until the sauce has mostly evaporated, and clings to the meat. Remove the meat from the saucepan, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

### Notes
- Tiger nuts don't have any close substitutes. Almonds are probably the closest substitute — I would suggest using 2 tsp almond meal. Sally Grainger suggests 1 tsp ground ginger, which results in a pleasant taste but to my palate one that is fairly different from using tiger nuts.
- This recipe appears to be a fairly "typical" form of *ofellae*: the meat is first roasted or boiled, then separate "fried" and served in an *oenogarum*. Apicius 7.4.5 and Vinidarius 4 give generic instructions of this form, but ingredients for the *oenogarum* are not specified. One could simply omit the tiger nuts (and, optionally, cumin) to recreate these more "generic" *ofellae* recipes.
