# Wild-Boar Style *Ofellae*

### Ingredients
- 750g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} belly
- 2 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- 2 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %}
- 1 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="mustard" %} seed
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="fennel" %} seed
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 90g {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 45ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 2 tsp cornstarch, made into a slurry

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 200C. Roast the pork belly in the oven until well done, about 1 hr. Once pork belly is cooked, remove from the oven and allow to rest for 20 minutes.
2. Slice the pork into bite-sized pieces, and add to a frying pan along with the spices, honey, fish sauce, and 30ml of water. Bring to a boil and cook for a few minutes.
3. Add the cornstarch slurry and stir for a couple minutes, until thickened. Remove from heat, and serve the meat coated in sauce.

### Notes
- The original recipe doesn't specify which spices to use, just that a "spice mix" (*condimentum*) is needed. I've used cumin, coriander, mustard seed, and fennel, following a spice mixture discovered by archaeologists in London.
- Serving *ofellae* with *liquamen* and honey appears to be a common alternative to *oenogarum*. Both Vinidarius 3 and 5 are also for *ofellae* in *liquamen* and honey, but omit the spices.
