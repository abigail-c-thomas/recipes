# Wild-Boar Style *Ofellae*

### Original Text
***ofellae aprogeneo more**: ex oleo liquamine condiuntur et mittitur eis condimentum cum cocte fuerint. et super adicitur his cum in foco sunt conditura, et denuo bulliunt: piper tritum condimentum mel liquamen; amulum cum iam bulliunt. et sine liquamine et oleo elixantur; cocuntur et sic piper <inferuntur>, perfunduntur ius supra scriptum et sic bulliunt.*

***Ofellae* in wild boar style**: They are seasoned with oil and fish sauce, and spices are added to them when they have been cooked. And while they are on the fire, seasoning is added to them, and they boil again: ground pepper, spices, honey, fish sauce; starch when they are already boiling. And they are also boiled without fish sauce and oil; they are cooked and thus <served> with pepper, the sauce described above is poured over them and thus they boil.

—*Apicius*, 7.4.3, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** Wild boar was considered a prestigious game meat in Roman cuisine, associated with hunting and elite dining. This recipe recreates the flavors of wild boar dishes using domestic pork, a common substitution even in ancient times. The term *ofellae* refers to small cuts of meat, typically cooked with richly flavored sauces. This preparation features the characteristic Roman combination of honey for sweetness with fish sauce for umami depth, plus a complex blend of spices that would have been quite expensive. The result is a dish that transforms everyday pork into something reminiscent of the more prestigious wild game served at upper-class banquets.

### Ingredients
- 750g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} belly
- 2 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- 2 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %}
- 1 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="mustard" %} seed
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="fennel" %} seed
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 90g {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 45ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 2 tsp cornstarch, made into a slurry

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 200C. Roast the pork belly in the oven until well done, about 1 hr. Once pork belly is cooked, remove from the oven and allow to rest for 20 minutes.
2. Slice the pork into bite-sized pieces, and add to a frying pan along with the spices, honey, fish sauce, and 30ml of water. Bring to a boil and cook for a few minutes.
3. Add the cornstarch slurry and stir for a couple minutes, until thickened. Remove from heat, and serve the meat coated in sauce.

### Notes
- The original recipe doesn't specify which spices to use, just that a "spice mix" (*condimentum*) is needed. I've used cumin, coriander, mustard seed, and fennel, following a spice mixture discovered by archaeologists in London.
- Serving *ofellae* with *liquamen* and honey appears to be a common alternative to *oenogarum*. Both Vinidarius 3 and 5 are also for *ofellae* in *liquamen* and honey, but omit the spices.
