# Fish with White Sauce

**Claude's intro:** This simple yet elegant fish preparation comes from Galen, the renowned Greek physician who served as personal doctor to several Roman emperors. Unlike the complex sauces of Apicius with their numerous ingredients and pungent flavors, Galen's approach to cooking was more aligned with his medical philosophy. He advocated for simple preparations that preserved the natural qualities of foods and enhanced their digestibility. This recipe exemplifies his approach, using minimal seasonings to create a gentle sauce that complements rather than masks the flavor of the fish. As a physician, Galen would have appreciated that this preparation method preserves the nutritional value of the fish while making it easy to digest.

### Ingredients
- 450g {% include ingredient_link.html name="salmon" %} fillets
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="leek" %}, finely chopped
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="dill" %} leaf
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}, plus more for serving
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="salt" %}

### Method
1. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan. Add the leeks and gently fry for a few minutes.
2. Add the salmon, along with 150ml of water, the dill leaf, and a few pinches of salt. Simmer until the salmon is cooked and the sauce has reduced somewhat.
3. Drizzle with a little more olive oil, if desired, and serve.

### Notes
- Galen doesn't specify which fish to use, but he discusses this preparation in his section for fish with "soft flesh." Salmon works well, though it would have been a river fish from northern Europe rarely mentioned by Greek writers.
- Roman writers like Cassiodorus and Anthimus recommended salmon to German kings in the 6th century CE.
- The "white sauce" is simply the cooking liquid from the fish and leeks, a far cry from modern white sauces that use flour, butter, or cream.
- This preparation highlights Galen's medical approach to cooking - simple methods that preserve the natural qualities and digestibility of ingredients.
