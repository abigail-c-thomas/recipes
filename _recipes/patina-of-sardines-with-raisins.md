# Patina of Sardines with Raisins

### Original Text
*Aliter patina de apua: apuam lauas. ova confringis et cum apua commisces. adicies liquamen, vinum, oleum. facies ut ferueat. cum ferbuerit, oenogarum ad eam facies, piper, ligusticum, origanum, facies ut ferueat. cum ferbuerit, amulo obligabis. asparges ut supra piper tritum et inferes.*

### English Translation
Another patina of whitebait: Wash the whitebait. Break eggs and mix with the whitebait. Add fish sauce, wine, and oil. Let it boil. When it has boiled, make an oenogarum for it with pepper, lovage, oregano, and let it boil. When it has boiled, thicken with starch. Sprinkle with ground pepper as above and serve.

—*Apicius*, 4.2.30, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This enriched version of a sardine patina demonstrates the Roman love for layered flavors. While the simpler Patina of Sardines recipe relies on herbs and basic seasonings, this variation adds depth with a thickened wine-fish sauce (oenogarum) and the sweetness of raisins. The addition of onions provides aromatic complexity, making this dish more substantial. Though the original recipe suggests using eggs, this adaptation focuses on the sauce components, creating a rich, glossy finish that would impress at a Roman dinner party. The combination of sweet and savory elements is characteristic of sophisticated Roman cuisine.

### Ingredients
- 5 whole {% include ingredient_link.html name="sardines" %} (about 450g)
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- ½ brown {% include ingredient_link.html name="onion" %}, finely chopped or pulverized
- 200 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 30 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="raisins" %}, finely chopped
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="oregano" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="cornstarch" %}, made into a slurry with water

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C / 400°F. Place the sardines in the oven and bake for 15 minutes, or until cooked through.
2. While the sardines are cooking, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Add the onions and cook for 5 minutes, until translucent.
3. Add the remaining ingredients to the frying pan, except the cornstarch, and simmer for 5 minutes.
4. Once the sardines are cooked, add them to the frying pan and bring back to a simmer. Add the cornstarch slurry, allow to thicken for a minute, and serve.

### Notes
- This recipe adapts Apicius 4.2.30, with some modifications to better suit modern tastes and ingredients.
- The original recipe calls for eggs as a binding agent, which have been replaced with cornstarch for a similar thickening effect.
- *Apua* (whitebait) mentioned in the original text were tiny fish eaten whole; sardines make a practical modern substitute.
- The addition of raisins is inspired by other Apicius recipes that combine fruit with fish for a sweet-savory balance.
