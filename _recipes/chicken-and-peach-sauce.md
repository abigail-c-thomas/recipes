# Boiled Chicken and Gourd with Peach Sauce

### Original Latin
*In persicis: pullum lavas, exossas, eo, deinde cucurbitas elixas minutatim concidis et in mortario fricabis cum medulla et cerebello pullino, piper, careum modicum, suffundis liquamen ita, ut permisceantur sibi ita contusis. persica enucleata in frictorio concoques et teres. deinde cum supradicta impensa temperabis. pullum refundis, ut repleatur, omento teges, in caccabum mittis. omnibus liquaminibus asperges.*

### English Translation
For peaches: Clean and bone the chicken, then chop boiled gourds into small pieces and grind in a mortar with marrow and chicken brains, pepper, a little caraway, and pour in fish sauce so that they mix together when pounded. Cook pitted peaches in a pan and grind. Then mix with the aforementioned stuffing. Pour back into the chicken so that it is filled, cover with caul fat, put in a pot. Sprinkle with all kinds of sauces.

—*Apicius*, 3.4.8, c. 4th century CE

Claude's intro: This refined dish combines boiled chicken and butternut squash (standing in for gourd) with a sweet-savory peach sauce. While the original recipe describes a stuffed chicken preparation, this adaptation simplifies the process by serving the chicken alongside the squash with the peach sauce drizzled over both. The combination of fruit with poultry was a hallmark of sophisticated Roman cuisine, and the complex mixture of herbs and spices creates a uniquely Roman flavor profile that balances sweet, savory, and aromatic elements.

### Ingredients
- 2 {% include ingredient_link.html name="chicken" %} thighs
- 300 g butternut squash, cut into large pieces
- 400 g can of peaches, drained
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- Two pinches of {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="caraway" %} seed
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="mint" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="pennyroyal" %}
- Small handful {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} leaf, chopped
- Small handful celery leaf, chopped
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="date syrup" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 1½ Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 1½ Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}

### Method
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the chicken thighs and simmer for 10 minutes, then add the butternut squash and simmer for another 15, or until both chicken and squash are cooked. Remove from the water and dry.
2. While the chicken and squash cook, mash the peaches and then mix with the rest of the remaining ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for a few minutes.
3. Plate the chicken and squash with the sauce drizzled on top.

### Notes
- This recipe is a simplified adaptation of Apicius 3.4.8, which originally described a more complex stuffed chicken dish.
- The original recipe called for chicken brains and marrow which have been omitted in this modern version.
- Butternut squash is used as a modern substitute for the "cucurbitas" (gourds) mentioned in the original recipe.
- The combination of fruit with meat dishes was common in wealthy Roman households, reflecting their taste for complex sweet-savory flavor combinations.
