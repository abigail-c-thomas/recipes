### Original Text

—*Apicius*, 3.4.8, c. 4th century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** This refined dish combines boiled chicken and butternut squash (standing in for gourd) with a sweet-savory peach sauce. The combination of fruit with poultry was a hallmark of sophisticated Roman cuisine, and the complex mixture of spices creates a uniquely Roman flavor profile that balances sweet, savory, and aromatic elements.

### Ingredients
- 2 chicken thighs
- 300 g butternut squash, cut into large pieces
- 400 g can of peaches, drained
- Ground pepper
- Two pinches of asafoetida
- ½ tsp caraway seed
- 1 tsp cumin
- ½ tsp mint
- ½ tsp pennyroyal
- Small handful coriander leaf, chopped
- Small handful celery leaf, chopped
- 1 Tb date syrup
- 1 Tb honey
- 3 Tb white wine
- 1½ Tb fish sauce
- 1 Tb olive oil
- 1½ Tb vinegar

### Method
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the chicken thighs and simmer for 10 minutes, then add the butternut squash and simmer for another 15, or until both chicken and squash are cooked. Remove from the water and dry.
2. While the chicken and squash cook, mash the peaches and then mix with the rest of the remaining ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for a few minutes.
3. Plate the chicken and squash with the sauce drizzled on top.

### Notes
This recipe is based on Apicius 3.4.8, which describes a peach sauce used with chicken and gourd. While the exact peach sauce recipe isn't included in the excerpt available from Apicius_raw_text.md, I've recreated a sauce that would be appropriate for this dish based on similar sauce recipes in Apicius, combining the typical Roman flavors of sweet, savory, and aromatic elements.
