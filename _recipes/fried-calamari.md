**Claude's intro:** This Roman recipe for fried calamari shows how seafood was prepared with a sweet-savory sauce typical of ancient Roman cuisine. While modern fried calamari is often served with a dipping sauce, the Romans preferred to toss the fried squid directly in a mixture of flavors. The combination of honey, fish sauce, and reduced wine creates a glossy coating that enhances the natural sweetness of fresh calamari.

### Ingredients
- 300 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="calamari" %}, cut into rings
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}
- Generous ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Thoroughly dry the calamari with a paper towel.
2. Place the olive oil in a frying pan and place on high heat. When the pan is very hot, add the calamari and fry for a couple minutes, until the calamari is opaque and beginning to curl.
3. Add in the remaining ingredients. Toss everything together for a minute, take off the heat, and serve.

### Notes
- *Carenum* in the original recipe was a type of reduced wine similar to *defrutum*.
- Quick cooking is essential for tender calamari - overcooking will make it rubbery.
- The sweet-sour-savory balance of this dish is characteristic of Roman cuisine.
- This preparation would have been common along the coastal areas of the Roman Empire.
