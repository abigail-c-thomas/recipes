### Original Latin
*In lolligine in patina: teres piper rutam mel modicum liquamen carenum, olei guttas.*

___

### Ingredients
- 300 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="calamari" %}, cut into rings
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}
- Generous ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Thoroughly dry the calamari with a paper towel.
2. Place the olive oil in a frying pan and place on high heat. When the pan is very hot, add the calamari and fry for a couple minutes, until the calamari is opaque and beginning to curl.
3. Add in the remaining ingredients. Toss everything together for a minute, take off the heat, and serve.

### Notes
- *Carenum* in the original recipe was a type of reduced wine similar to *defrutum*.
- Quick cooking is essential for tender calamari - overcooking will make it rubbery.
- The sweet-sour-savory balance of this dish is characteristic of Roman cuisine.
- This preparation would have been common along the coastal areas of the Roman Empire.
