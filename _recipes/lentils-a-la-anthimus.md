# Lentils a la Anthimus

### Original Source
This recipe is adapted from Anthimus' "On the Observance of Foods" (De observatione ciborum), a medical treatise written around 500 CE for Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths.

â€”*Anthimus*, De observatione ciborum, 67, c. 500 CE

**Claude's intro:** This simple lentil preparation comes from Anthimus, a Byzantine Greek physician who served as ambassador to Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths. Written around 500 CE, his work "On the Observance of Foods" bridges late Roman and early medieval cuisine, showing how classical medical traditions adapted to changing cultural contexts. Unlike many Roman recipes, Anthimus specifically advises against using fish sauce (*garum*), instead recommending simple seasonings that highlight the natural flavors of the lentils. This preference reflects both changing tastes and possibly the decreasing availability of fish sauce as trade networks shifted in the post-Roman world.

### Ingredients
- 250g red {% include ingredient_link.html name="lentils" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 2 Tb olive oil
- 3 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="sumac" %}
- 2 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} seed
- A small bunch of coriander leaf (cilantro), loosely chopped

### Method
1. Bring 500ml of water to the boil. Add the lentils and cook for about 45 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through and become mushy. Stir occasionally to prevent lentils sticking, and add more water as needed to prevent them drying out.
2. Add the vinegar, olive oil, sumac, and coriander seed along with a generous pinch of salt. Stir everything together and taste, seasoning with extra salt and olive oil if desired, and allow to simmer for an additional few minutes. 
3. Garnish with the coriander leaf and serve.

### Notes
Anthimus specifically advised against using fish sauce in this recipe, preferring the clean taste of simple seasonings. However, for those accustomed to Roman flavors, a splash of fish sauce can be substituted for the salt. The sumac adds a pleasant tangy flavor that complements the earthiness of the lentils.
