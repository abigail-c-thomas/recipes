# Oxyporium

### Original Text
*Oxypori compositio: cumini unciae II, gingiber(is) unciam I, rutae viridis unciam I, dactilorum pinguium scripulos XII, piperis unciam I, mellis uncias VIIII cuminum aut Aethiopicum aut Siriacum aut Libicum. tundes cuminum et postea infundes in aceto. cum siccaverit postea melle omnia conprehendes; cum necesse fuerit dimidium coclearum <cum> aceto et liquamine modico misces aut post cenam dimidium coclearum accipies.*

### English Translation
Composition of oxyporium: 2 ounces of cumin, 1 ounce of ginger, 1 ounce of fresh rue, 12 scruples of fat dates, 1 ounce of pepper, 9 ounces of honey, and Ethiopian, Syrian, or Libyan cumin. Grind the cumin and then soak it in vinegar. When it has dried, mix everything with honey. When needed, mix half a spoonful with vinegar and a little fish sauce, or take half a spoonful after dinner.

—*Apicius*, 1.32 and 3.18.2, c. 4th century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** The *oxyporium* was a highly-spiced medicinal mixture served with *oxygarum* (vinegar and fish sauce) or eaten by the spoonful. It was particularly recommended to accompany lettuce, which Romans believed could be potentially indigestible. The strong spices were thought to aid digestion and counter any harmful effects of raw vegetables. This preparation demonstrates the overlap between culinary arts and medicine in Roman culture, where many foods were valued not just for their taste but for their perceived health benefits. The inclusion of potent ingredients like pepper, ginger, and rue reflects the Roman understanding of digestive health, which held that powerful spices could help "correct" the innate qualities of other foods.

### Ingredients
- 2 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}  
- 1 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="ginger" %}  
- 1 tsp ground black {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}  
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}  
- Half a {% include ingredient_link.html name="date" %}, finely chopped  
- 60g {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- 30ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}  
- 20ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}

### Method
1. Mix all the ingredients together and let sit for half an hour, then strain through a sieve if desired.

2. Serve with lettuce as a salad dressing, or consume alongside lettuce by the teaspoon.

### Notes
In the original recipe, quantities are given for everything but the vinegar and fish sauce, which is unusual for ancient culinary recipes but common in medicinal recipes. I've used a 2:1 honey to vinegar ratio, which is common in other Roman recipes.

*Oxygarum* is usually equal parts vinegar to fish sauce, but modern fish sauce is likely stronger than what the ancient Romans used, so I've reduced the quantity somewhat.

This recipe is duplicated in Apicius, with 3.18.2 giving further details and stating that the *oxyporium* should be served with lettuce "to render the lettuce harmless" (*ne lactucae laedant*). This reflects the ancient belief that certain foods could have harmful effects if not properly balanced with other ingredients.

Rue is a bitter herb that was commonly used in Roman cooking but is now rarely used culinary. It can be omitted if unavailable, though it contributes to the authentic bitter-spicy flavor profile of the dish.
