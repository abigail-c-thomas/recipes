# Chicken in Sour Sauce

### Original Text
*Pullum oxizomum: olei acetabulum maiorem, \<uini\> satis modice, liquaminis acetabulum minorem, aceti acetabulum perquam minorem, piperis scripulos sex, petrosilinum scripulum, porros fasciculum.*

Sour sauce chicken: A larger measure of oil, a modest amount of wine, a smaller measure of fish sauce, an even smaller measure of vinegar, six scruples of pepper, a scruple of parsley, and a bundle of leeks.

—*Apicius*, 6.8.4, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This recipe features chicken in a tangy sauce where the sour notes from the vinegar and wine are balanced by the richness of the olive oil and umami from the fish sauce. The leeks and parsley add aromatic notes to this simple but flavorful dish.

### Ingredients
- 4 chicken thighs
- 1 small leek, thoroughly washed
- A couple sprigs of parsley
- 1½ tsp black pepper
- 50 ml olive oil
- 40 ml fish sauce
- 40 ml white wine
- 30 ml white wine vinegar

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C / 350 F.
2. Place the chicken in a dutch oven, skin side up, along with the leek. Add the remaining ingredients to the dutch oven, place in the oven, and cook for 50 minutes.
3. Discard the leek and the parsley. Plate the chicken, drizzled with some of the sauce, and serve.
