# Salt Meat Stew

### Original Text
Κρέα ταρειχηρὰ ἢ περνῶν τεμάχη· κρέα ὁμοίως ὠμά· τὰ μὲν ταρειχηρὰ προζεννύουσιν ἵνα ἐξαλμίσῃ μόνον· εἶτα πάντα εἰς λοπάδα· οἴνου μέρη δ, γλυκέως μέρη β̅, ὄξους μέρος α, κόρι ξηρὸν, θύμον, ἄννησον, μάραθον· φρῦξον, πάντα ἐξ ἀρχῆς όμοῦ ἐπιβαλών. ἕψει· μεσάζουσιν ἐπιβαλὼν μέλι καὶ κύμεινον λεῖον, ἄλλοι καὶ πίπερ, καὶ βαλόντες εἰς ἀγγεῖον θερμὸν τὸν ζωμὸν ἐπιβάλλουσιν ψωμοὺς ψοιῶν καὶ ἄρτων θερμῶν.

Salt meat or ham pieces; raw meat in the same way. First boil the salted meat so that only the salt is drawn out. Then put everything in a pot: 4 parts wine, 2 parts sweet wine, 1 part vinegar, dried coriander, thyme, anise, fennel. Roast these, adding all of them from the beginning and cook. Halfway through, add honey and ground cumin (some add pepper too), and putting the hot broth into a vessel, they add pieces of warm breads.

—*Heidelberg Papyrus*, c. 3rd century CE

This hearty stew transforms preserved meat with a complex mixture of spices, wine, and honey. The bread serves as both flavoring and thickening agent, creating a rich and satisfying dish.

### Ingredients
- 1 kg corned beef or gammon
- 1 L white wine
- 500 ml grape juice
- 250 ml white wine vinegar
- 1½ tsp ground coriander
- 2 tsp aniseed
- 2 tsp fennel seed
- 2 tsp dried thyme
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 60 ml honey
- 1 tsp coarsely ground black pepper
- 5 slices of white bread

### Method
1. Toast the fennel seeds and aniseed in a small fry pan, then grind to powder in a mortar and pestle
2. Cut meat into small chunks, and place in a saucepan along with the wine, juice, and vinegar. Bring to a simmer, then add the fennel, aniseed, thyme, and coriander
3. Once the stew has been simmering for 30 minutes, add the cumin, honey, and pepper. Break the bread into small pieces and add to the stew. Continue to simmer for another 15 minutes or so, until the bread has disintegrated and the stew has thickened.
