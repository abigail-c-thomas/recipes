# Duck in Prune Sauce

### Original Latin
*In grue in anate uel in pullo: piper cepam siccam ligusticum cuminum apii semen pruna uel damascena enucleata mustum acetum liquamen defritum oleum et coques. gruem cum coquis, caput eius aquam non contingat, sed sit foris ab aqua. cum cocta fuerit, de sauano calido inuolues gruem et caput eius trahe cum neruis: sequetur ut pulpe uel ossa remaneant; cum neruis enim manducare non potest.*

### English Translation
For crane, duck, or chicken: pepper, dried onion, lovage, cumin, celery seed, prunes or damascene [plums] with pits removed, grape juice, vinegar, fish sauce, *defrutum*, oil, and cook. When cooking crane, its head should not touch the water but remain outside it. When it is cooked, wrap the crane in a hot towel and pull the head with the tendons: it will follow so that the meat or bones remain; for it cannot be eaten with the tendons.

—*Apicius*, 6.2.2, c. 4th century CE

**Ingredients**

* 1 duck  
* ½ tsp ground black pepper  
* 1 tsp lovage  
* 2 tsp cumin  
* ½ tsp celery seed, ground  
* ½ an onion  
* 200 g dried prunes  
* 200 ml wine  
* 40 ml fish sauce  
* 20 ml vinegar  
* 20 ml *defrutum*, for sauce  
* 60 ml *defrutum*, for basting  
* 15 ml olive oil

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 230C/450F. Place the duck on a roast tray breast side down with a little water covering the tray bottom. Baste with a little defrutum, then place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes.  
2. Rotate the duck, then bake for another 20 minutes. Baste with *defrutum*, then bake for another 10 minutes. Baste once more, then roast another 5–10 minutes or until cooked. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before carving.  
3. While the duck roasts, coarsely chop the onions, then place in a saucepan along with the remaining sauce ingredients. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, then take off the heat and allow to cool.  
4. Place the sauce into a food processor and blend until smooth. Pour back into the saucepan and bring gently back to heat. Serve the duck with the sauce. 

**Notes**

* I didn't get the duck skin crispy with the above method and tbh wasn't that impressed, maybe should try [this method](https://mapleleaffarms.com/recipes/roasted-whole-duck-basic-recipe-for-crispy-skin) next?  
* Also had difficulty getting the duck defrosted, it needs at least 2 days in the fridge
