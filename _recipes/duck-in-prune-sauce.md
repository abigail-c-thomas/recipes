# Duck in Prune Sauce

### Original Text
*In grue in anate uel in pullo: piper cepam siccam ligusticum cuminum apii semen pruna uel damascena enucleata mustum acetum liquamen defritum oleum et coques. gruem cum coquis, caput eius aquam non contingat, sed sit foris ab aqua. cum cocta fuerit, de sauano calido inuolues gruem et caput eius trahe cum neruis: sequetur ut pulpe uel ossa remaneant; cum neruis enim manducare non potest.*

### English Translation
For crane, duck, or chicken: pepper, dried onion, lovage, cumin, celery seed, prunes or damascene [plums] with pits removed, grape juice, vinegar, fish sauce, *defrutum*, oil, and cook. When cooking crane, its head should not touch the water but remain outside it. When it is cooked, wrap the crane in a hot towel and pull the head with the tendons: it will follow so that the meat or bones remain; for it cannot be eaten with the tendons.

—*Apicius*, 6.2.2, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This luxurious duck recipe showcases the Roman fondness for fruit-based sauces with poultry. The combination of sweet prunes with savory spices creates a rich, complex flavor profile that would have been considered sophisticated dining in ancient Rome. While the original recipe offers flexibility in using duck, chicken, or even crane (a status food in Roman times), duck works particularly well with the sauce's deep flavors. The cooking method, with multiple rounds of basting with *defrutum* (reduced grape must), helps develop a caramelized exterior while maintaining a succulent interior, techniques that are still valued in modern roasting.

### Ingredients
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="duck" %}
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="celery seed" %}, ground
- ½ an {% include ingredient_link.html name="onion" %}
- 200 g dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="prunes" %}
- 200 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}
- 40 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 20 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 20 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}, for sauce
- 60 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}, for basting
- 15 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 230C/450F. Place the duck on a roast tray breast side down with a little water covering the tray bottom. Baste with a little defrutum, then place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes.
2. Rotate the duck, then bake for another 20 minutes. Baste with *defrutum*, then bake for another 10 minutes. Baste once more, then roast another 5–10 minutes or until cooked. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before carving.
3. While the duck roasts, coarsely chop the onions, then place in a saucepan along with the remaining sauce ingredients. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, then take off the heat and allow to cool.
4. Place the sauce into a food processor and blend until smooth. Pour back into the saucepan and bring gently back to heat. Serve the duck with the sauce.

### Notes
- For crispier duck skin, try scoring the skin before cooking or using a higher temperature initially (230°C/450°F for 15 minutes) then reducing to 180°C/350°F.
- Duck needs at least 2 days to defrost properly in the refrigerator.
- The original recipe also mentions this preparation for crane or chicken - duck provides the richest flavor among these options.
- The prune sauce exemplifies the Roman love of combining fruit with meat dishes for a sweet-savory balance.
