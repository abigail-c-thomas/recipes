# Pottage with Milk and Tracta

### Original Text
> Aliter: pultes tractogalatae: lacte et tracta coques, coagulatum melle perfundis et inferes.

"Another: pottage with pasta and milk: cook with milk and tracta, pour honey over the thickened mixture and serve."

â€”*Apicius*, 5.1.3, c. 4th century CE

___

This Roman dish combines milk and tracta (a type of thin pastry) to create a sweet, pudding-like porridge. The addition of honey makes this more of a dessert than a savory dish, though the Romans didn't distinguish between sweet and savory courses as we do today.

### Ingredients
- 500 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="milk" %}  
- 50 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="cornstarch" %}  
- 60 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method
Whisk together the milk and cornstarch in a saucepan. Heat while constantly stirring, until the mixture becomes very thick. Add the honey, olive oil, and a pinch of salt, mixing all together, and serve.
