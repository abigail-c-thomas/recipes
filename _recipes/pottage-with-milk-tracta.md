**Claude's intro:** This Roman dish combines milk and tracta (a type of thin pastry) to create a sweet, pudding-like porridge. Tracta was a thin sheet of dough similar to a modern pasta or pastry that was used to thicken and enrich various dishes. The addition of honey transforms what might otherwise be a simple porridge into a dessert-like dish, though the Romans didn't distinguish between sweet and savory courses as we do today. This recipe demonstrates how Romans could create creamy, pudding-like confections with just a few basic ingredients.

### Ingredients
- 500 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="milk" %}  
- 50 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="cornstarch" %}  
- 60 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method
Whisk together the milk and cornstarch in a saucepan. Heat while constantly stirring, until the mixture becomes very thick. Add the honey, olive oil, and a pinch of salt, mixing all together, and serve.
