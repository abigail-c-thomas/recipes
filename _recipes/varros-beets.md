# Varro's Beets

### Original Text
> Varro: betacios sed nigros quorum detegsas radices et mulsu decoctas cum sale modico et oleo, vel sale aqua et oleo in se coctas; iusculum facere et potari; melius etiam si in eo pullus sit decoctus.

"Varro: black beets whose roots you peel and cook in honeyed wine with a little salt and oil, or cooked in their own juice with salt, water, and oil; make a broth and drink it; it is even better if a chicken is cooked in it."

—*Apicius*, *De Re Coquinaria* 3.2.3, 4th-5th century CE
