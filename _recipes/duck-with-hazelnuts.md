**Claude's intro:** This dish combines the rich flavor of duck with the earthy sweetness of hazelnuts for a satisfying meal that draws inspiration from Roman cooking techniques. Though not directly from an ancient source text, the recipe uses traditional Roman flavor combinations and ingredients that would have been familiar to wealthy Romans.

### Ingredients
- 4 duck leg and thighs
- 100g hazelnuts
- 180 ml red wine
- 80 ml fish sauce
- 1 Tb olive oil
- 1 Tb vinegar
- 1 Tb honey
- 1½ tsp dried mint
- 1½ tsp chopped fresh parsley
- Pepper

### Method
1. Roast hazelnuts at 180℃ for 10 minutes, then blend into a fine crumb
2. Place the duck pieces into an oven dish, skin up. Season with pepper.
3. Combine the wine, fish sauce, oil, vinegar, honey, and herbs into a mixing jug and stir to combine. Pour three quarters of the liquid over the duck.
4. Mix the remaining liquid with the hazelnut. Pat down the hazelnut mixture onto the exposed skin of the duck to form a coat. (Any remaining hazelnut mixture should be added to the oven dish, where it will float.)
5. Roast the duck at 180℃ for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve with a little of the cooking liquid.
