**Claude's intro:** Vinidarius' recipe for *ofellas garaton* represents the continued popularity of *ofellae* (small cuts of meat) in late Roman cuisine, but with a simplified preparation compared to the more elaborate versions found in earlier Apician texts. This recipe has strong eastern influences, combining the distinctive flavors of *laser* (asafoetida), ginger, and cardamom - spices that reflect the extensive trade networks that persisted even during the decline of the Western Roman Empire. The name "garaton" suggests these meat cuts are defined by their preparation in a spiced *garum* (fish sauce) mixture, highlighting how this fermented sauce remained central to Roman cuisine even in the late 5th century as culinary practices were evolving.

### Ingredients
- 700g bone-in {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} spare ribs, chopped into bite-sized pieces
- 60 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="ginger" %}
- ¾ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="cardamom" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C / 390°F. Place the pork onto a baking tray, place in the oven, and bake for 40 minutes.
2. Place the pork into a small dutch oven along with the fish sauce, spices, and 300 ml of water. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 30 minutes or until the pork is falling off the bone. Remove the spare ribs from the cooking broth and serve.
