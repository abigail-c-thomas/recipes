# Baked Horse-Mackerel

### English Translation
"A. Do you understand how you should prepare the horse-mackerel? B. Why, I shall if you will proceed to tell me. A. First take out the gills, wash it well, cut off the spiny fins and all about it, split it nicely, then spread out the whole in two halves, then whip it well and thoroughly with silphium and cover it with cheese, salt, and oregano."

—*Athenaeus*, quoting Alexis, 322c-d, c. 210 CE

___

### Ingredients
- A 500g horse-mackerel (or any white fish fillet)
- 125g chevre {% include ingredient_link.html name="cheese" %} (or feta, or other strongly flavoured cheese)
- ½ tsp of {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="oregano" %}, or leaves from two fresh sprigs
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="salt" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F.
2. If using a whole mackerel, split open the fish down the belly and open it out. Remove the spine and as many bones as you can, then place flesh side up onto a baking tray. (If using fish fillets, simply place on a baking tray with skin, if present touching the tray.)
3. Evenly sprinkle salt and asafoetida over the fish. Next, crumble over the cheese, then finally sprinkle over the oregano.
4. Place in the oven to bake for 20 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. Then turn on the broiler and broil until the cheese is golden brown.

### Notes
- This recipe comes from a quotation in Athenaeus' *Deipnosophistae* (Philosophers at Dinner), a work that preserves many fragments of ancient Greek culinary traditions.
- The original text refers to silphium, an extinct plant highly prized in the ancient world. Asafoetida is used as the closest available substitute.
- The combination of fish and cheese, which might seem unusual to modern Western tastes, was common in ancient Greek cuisine.
- Horse-mackerel can be substituted with any firm white fish fillets if unavailable.
