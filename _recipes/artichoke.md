# Artichoke

### Original Text

"Another way with boiled cardoons: pepper, cumin, fish sauce, and oil."

—*Apicius*, 3.19.3, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This simple recipe showcases the Roman approach to cooking artichokes (or more likely their ancestor, cardoons). The aromatic dipping sauce enhances the natural flavor of the vegetable with complementary savory notes. Cardoons were a popular vegetable in ancient Rome, often featured in Apicius' cookbook, and this minimalist preparation highlights the Roman fondness for aromatic seasonings like cumin and the essential fish sauce (garum or liquamen) that gave many Roman dishes their distinctive umami character.

### Ingredients
- 1 globe {% include ingredient_link.html name="artichoke" %} bulb  
- 1½ Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- A pinch of {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}  
- Ground black {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}

### Method
1. Steam the artichoke for 25–35 minutes, until the outer leaves can easily be pulled off. Alternatively, wrap the artichoke in damp paper towels and microwave for 10 minutes.

2. Mix together the remaining ingredients in a small bowl. Dip the leaves and eat the normal way, then remove the choke and eat the heart with the sauce.

### Notes
This recipe was originally for cardoons, of which the artichoke is a cultivated variety. It's unclear whether the ancient Romans cultivated artichokes or consumed wild cardoons, but since cardoons are difficult to find I've substituted the artichokes instead.
