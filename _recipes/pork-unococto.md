# Pork *Unococto*

### Original Text
*XXI. porcello unocoto: porcellum accipies, ornauis, quoque in oleo et liquamen. cum quoquitur adicies in mortario piper ruta baca lauri liquamen, passu siue carenu, uino uetus; simul omnia teres. temperas et traicies in patinam heneam. mittis eum \[XXII\] porcellum eo iure, perquoque; cum autem leuas, amulo oblicabis et sic in uas transfers et inferes.*

### English Translation
XXI. One-cooked suckling pig: Take a suckling pig, prepare it, and cook it in oil and fish sauce. While it is cooking, add to a mortar black pepper, rue, bay berries, fish sauce, *passum* or *carenum*, and aged wine; grind all together. Mix and transfer to a bronze dish. Put the suckling pig in this sauce, cook thoroughly; when you remove it, thicken with starch and thus transfer to a vessel and serve.

—*Vinidarius*, 21-22, c. 500

**Claude's intro:** The *porcellum unocoto* (one-cooked suckling pig) is a dish from Vinidarius' late 5th-century recipe collection that demonstrates both continuity with earlier Roman cuisine and some simplification. The term "unococto" likely refers to the cooking method where the meat is first prepared in one way (cooking in oil and fish sauce) and then finished in a sauce. This two-stage cooking approach creates layers of flavor while incorporating classic Roman ingredients like rue, bay berries, and wine reduction (*passum*/*carenum*). The recipe showcases the continued importance of the mortar and pestle for creating complex sauces even as cooking methods became more straightforward in the post-Imperial period.

### Ingredients
- 1.5 kg {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} shoulder
- 4 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 1 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 3 {% include ingredient_link.html name="bay berries" %}, crushed
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- 120 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="passum" %}
- 120 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 2 tsp cornstarch, made into slurry

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 160°C / 325°F.
2. Place the pork shoulder into a dutch oven or baking dish. Pour over the olive oil and half of the fish sauce, then place covered in the oven for 45 minutes.
3. While the pork cooks, prepare the sauce. First crush the bay berries, black pepper, and dried rue in a mortar and pestle. Combine in a bowl with the *passum*, wine, and remaining fish sauce.
4. Once the pork has cooked for 45 minutes, remove from the oven. Pour over the sauce, and then return to the oven, covered, for another 45-60 minutes, or until the pork is fork-tender.
5. Remove the pork to a serving dish and cover loosely with foil. Pour the cooking liquid into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the cornstarch slurry and stir until thickened.
6. Slice the pork and serve with the thickened sauce.

### Notes
- The term *unococto* likely refers to the one-pot cooking method used in this recipe.
