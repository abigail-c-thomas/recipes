### Ingredients
- 1.5 kg {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} shoulder
- 4 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 1 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 3 {% include ingredient_link.html name="bay berries" %}, crushed
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- 120 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="passum" %}
- 120 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 2 tsp cornstarch, made into slurry

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 160°C / 325°F.
2. Place the pork shoulder into a dutch oven or baking dish. Pour over the olive oil and half of the fish sauce, then place covered in the oven for 45 minutes.
3. While the pork cooks, prepare the sauce. First crush the bay berries, black pepper, and dried rue in a mortar and pestle. Combine in a bowl with the *passum*, wine, and remaining fish sauce.
4. Once the pork has cooked for 45 minutes, remove from the oven. Pour over the sauce, and then return to the oven, covered, for another 45-60 minutes, or until the pork is fork-tender.
5. Remove the pork to a serving dish and cover loosely with foil. Pour the cooking liquid into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the cornstarch slurry and stir until thickened.
6. Slice the pork and serve with the thickened sauce.

### Notes
- The term *unococto* likely refers to the one-pot cooking method used in this recipe.
