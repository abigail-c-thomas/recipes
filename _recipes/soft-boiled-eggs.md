### Ingredients
- 150g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pine nuts" %}, soaked in 75 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1½ Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 1½ Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 6 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}

### Method
1. First prepare the sauce by combining all ingredients, except for the eggs, into a food processor and blending until smooth. Taste and adjust as desired.
2. Bring a small pot full of water to the boil. Add the eggs and continue to boil for six minutes.
3. Fill a large bowl with cool water. Once the eggs have boiled, take them out and place in the water and let cool for a few minutes.
4. Once cooled, shell the eggs and slice in half. Spoon a little of the sauce onto each egg half, and serve.
