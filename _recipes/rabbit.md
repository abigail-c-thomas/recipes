# Rabbit

### Original Latin
*Leporem madidum: in aqua precoquitur modice, deinde conponitur in patina ac coquendus oleo in furno et cum prope sit coctus ex alio oleo. pertangito de conditura infra scripta: teres piper <ligusticum> satureiam cepam rutam apii semen liquamen laser uinum et modice olei. aliquotiens uersatur, in ipsa percoquitur conditura.*

### English Translation
Tender hare: pre-cook it moderately in water, then place in a pan and cook in oil in the oven, and when it is nearly cooked, brush it with the sauce described below: grind pepper, lovage, savory, onion, rue, celery seed, fish sauce, *laser*, wine, and a little oil. Turn it several times and cook thoroughly in this sauce.

—*Apicius*, 8.8.1, c. 4th century CE

### Ingredients
- 1 rabbit (about 1.3 kg)
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 1 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="savory" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="celery seed" %}
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- 1 small {% include ingredient_link.html name="onion" %}, finely chopped
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- 300 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 45 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F.
2. Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Place the rabbit in pieces into the pot and allow to cook for a few minutes.
3. Remove the rabbit and pat dry. Coat in olive oil and arrange in a roasting tray, then place in the oven for 20 minutes.
4. In a jug, combine the remaining ingredients along with a tablespoon of olive oil. Pour over the rabbit, tossing the pieces to make sure everything is covered, then return to the oven.
5. Cook for a further 10–15 minutes, basting after 5 minutes. Once the juices run clear the meat is cooked. Serve the rabbit with a little of the pan juices.

### Notes
- This recipe is for hare but hare is difficult to find in many areas, so rabbit has been substituted.
- The pre-cooking in water helps to tenderize the meat, a technique Apicius recommends for game.
- *Laser* in the original recipe refers to asafoetida, a resinous gum used extensively in Roman cooking.
- The flavor profile of this dish - with its combination of herbs, wine, and fish sauce - is distinctly Roman.
