# Herb Sauce for Fried Fish

### Original Latin
*Ius diabotanon in pisce frixo: piscem quemlibet curas, lauas, friges. teres piper cuminum coriandri semen laseris radicem origanum rutam, fricabis; suffundes acetum, adicies careotam mel defritum oleum, liquamen temperabis; refundes in caccabum, facies ut ferueat; cum ferbuerit, piscem frictum perfundes, piper asperges et inferes.*

### English Translation
Herb sauce for fried fish: prepare any fish, wash it, and fry it. Grind pepper, cumin, coriander seed, *laser* root, oregano, and rue, crush them; pour in vinegar, add date, honey, *defrutum*, oil, and mix with fish sauce; pour back into the pot, bring to a boil; when it boils, pour over the fried fish, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

—*Apicius*, 10.1.1, c. 4th century CE

**Ingredients**

* 500g fish fillets, or a whole 750g fish  
* ½ tsp ground black pepper  
* ½ tsp cumin  
* ½ tsp coriander seed  
* ½ tsp asafoetida  
* ½ tsp dried oregano  
* ½ tsp dried rue  
* 4 dates, minced (or 2 Tb date syrup)  
* 1 Tb olive oil (additional for frying)  
* 2 Tb honey  
* 2 Tb *defrutum*  
* 3 Tb red wine vinegar  
* 1½ Tb *liquamen* 

**Method**

1. Add all of the ingredients (other than the fish) to a small saucepan, mix together, and gently bring to a simmer for a few minutes. Taste and adjust as needed, then turn down the heat to keep warm while the fish is being fried.   
2. Heat a little olive oil in a skillet, then fry the fish until cooked.   
3. Plate the fish with the sauce drizzled over it, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

**Notes**

* Vinidarius 8 is very similar, and both texts clearly share a common origin. The sauce is slightly different in that it omits cumin and honey  
* Interesting the dates in Apicius 10.1.1 appear with the liquids and perhaps refers to date syrup, while those in Vinidarius 8 are explicitly pounded  
* Both recipes say that they can be used on any fish
