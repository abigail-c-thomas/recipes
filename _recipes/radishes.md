# Radishes with Pepper Sauce

This exceptionally simple Roman recipe brings out the peppery flavor of fresh radishes with a pungent sauce of ground pepper and fish sauce. Despite its simplicity, it showcases the Roman fondness for bold, contrasting flavors.

### Ingredients
- 5 medium {% include ingredient_link.html name="radish" %}es  
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- ½ tsp black {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}corns

### Method
1. Slice the radishes.

2. Grind the peppercorns with the fish sauce in a mortar and pestle, drizzle over the radishes, and serve.

### Notes
Radishes were a common vegetable in ancient Rome, often eaten at the beginning of meals to stimulate the appetite. Pliny the Elder mentions several varieties of radishes in his *Natural History*, noting they were popular enough to have inspired passionate opinions about their quality.

The combination of fish sauce (liquamen) and black pepper was fundamental to Roman cuisine and appears in countless recipes. Fish sauce provided the salty element (functioning like salt in modern cooking), while freshly ground pepper added both heat and aromatic complexity.

For a more modern interpretation, you could add a small amount of olive oil to the dressing, though the original recipe doesn't call for it.

This dish is perfect as a simple appetizer or as part of a larger spread of Roman-style mezze dishes.
