**Claude's intro:** This concise recipe from Apicius exemplifies the Roman appreciation for offal and economical cooking. While modern diners might consider tripe and other offal as "lesser" cuts, Romans of all social classes valued these ingredients for their unique textures and flavors. The minimal seasonings—just fish sauce, asafoetida (laser), and pepper—reflect a common Roman approach of using powerful aromatics and fermented condiments to enhance simple ingredients. This dish likely served as part of the gustatio (appetizer course) in a formal Roman meal, demonstrating that nose-to-tail eating has ancient roots in Mediterranean cuisine.

### Ingredients
- 400 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="tripe" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Place the tripe in a large pot, cover with water, and boil for 1.5 hours.
2. Cut the tripe into bite-sized pieces and place in a serving bowl. Pour over the fish sauce and asafoetida, grind over it a generous amount of black pepper, toss, and serve.

### Notes
- This remarkably simple recipe showcases the Roman appreciation for offal and nose-to-tail eating.
- Tripe requires thorough cleaning and extended cooking time to become tender.
- The flavoring is minimal but effective - the pungent asafoetida (referred to as *laser* in the original) combined with fish sauce creates an umami-rich dressing.
- In Roman times, this dish would likely have been served as part of the *gustatio* (appetizer course).
