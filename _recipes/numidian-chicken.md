Numidian chicken: Prepare the chicken, boil it, remove it from the water, sprinkle with laser (asafoetida) and pepper, and roast it. Pound pepper, cumin, coriander seed, laser root, rue, dates, and pine nuts. Pour in vinegar, honey, fish sauce, and oil. Mix well. When it boils, thicken with starch. Pour over the chicken, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

—*Apicius*, 6.8.5, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This flavorful chicken dish gets its name from the ancient North African kingdom of Numidia. The combination of fragrant spices with sweet dates and honey creates a complex sauce that transforms simple chicken into a dish worthy of a Roman banquet.

### Ingredients
- 4 chicken thighs, with skin and bone
- 2 × ½ tsp of asafoetida, separated
- 30 g pine nuts
- 4 dates
- Ground pepper
- 2 tsp cumin
- 2 tsp coriander seed
- 1 tsp rue
- 2 Tb vinegar
- 2 Tb honey
- 3 Tb fish sauce
- 2 Tb oil
- 1.5 Tb cornstarch, made into a slurry

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F
2. Rub ½ tsp of asafoetida onto the chicken thighs, then sprinkle ground pepper over. Place in a roasting tray and roast for 45 minutes, or until cooked through and the skin is golden
3. Place the dates in a bowl with a little water and microwave for 1 minute to soften. Place in a food processor with the pine nuts and blend into a paste.
4. Add the pine nut/date paste to a saucepan along with the remaining ingredients (excluding the cornstarch slurry). Add a generous amount of ground pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for a couple minutes. Taste and adjust as desired - you may wish to add a couple tablespoons of water to reduce the intensity of the sauce.
5. Add the cornstarch slurry, a little at a time, while the saucepan is over the heat, until a thick consistency is reached.
6. Plate the chicken thighs and then cover in the sauce. Sprinkle on some additional black pepper.

### Notes
This dish might be named after Numidia, a region in North Africa. It is also possible it is named after the guinea fowl, usually *meleagris* but also known as the *gallina Numidica* - the modern scientific name is *Numida meleagris*. Indeed, the term *pullum* used throughout Section 6.8 means "chicken" but can also be used for fowl more broadly, and guinea fowl could be used as an authentic substitute for chicken in any of these recipes.
