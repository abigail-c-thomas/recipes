# Chickpeas with Cheese

### Original Source
This recipe comes from Galen's treatise "On the Powers of Food" (De Alimentorum Facultatibus), where he discusses simple and healthful food preparations.

â€”*Galen*, On the Powers of Food, R6, c. 2nd century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** This extraordinarily simple dish demonstrates Galen's practical approach to nutrition. As the most influential physician of antiquity, Galen was not just concerned with elaborate medicinal preparations but also with straightforward, healthful everyday meals. This combination of legumes and aged cheese creates a complete protein source that would have provided substantial nutrition. The simplicity of the preparation suggests this was a practical dish for ordinary people rather than an elite preparation, highlighting Galen's concern with food for all social classes.

### Ingredients
- 400g can {% include ingredient_link.html name="chickpeas" %}, drained
- 100g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pecorino romano" %} or {% include ingredient_link.html name="parmesan" %}, finely grated

### Method
Place the chickpeas into a frying pan along with a little water and bring to a simmer to heat the chickpeas through. Remove from the heat and add the cheese, toss, and serve.

### Notes
Galen might have used fresh-cooked chickpeas rather than the canned variety available today. He considered chickpeas to be warming and drying, while cheese could be cooling or warming depending on its age. The combination would have created what he considered a balanced meal. While extraordinarily simple, this dish creates a rich, creamy coating on the chickpeas as the cheese melts, making a satisfying quick meal.
