# Libum

### Original Text
> Libum hoc modo facito. Casei P. II bene disterat in mortario. Ubi bene distriverit, farinae siligineae libram aut, si voles tenerius esse, selibram similaginis eodem indito permiscetoque cum caseo bene. Ovum unum addito et una permisceto bene. Inde panem facito, folia subdito, in foco caldo sub testu coquito leniter.

"Make libum by this method: Break up two pounds of cheese well in a mortar. When this is done well, add a pound of wheat flour or, if you want it to be more delicate, a half-pound of fine flour, and mix it thoroughly with the cheese. Add one egg and mix together well. Make a loaf of this, place it on leaves, and cook slowly on a hot hearth under an earthen pot."

â€”*Cato*, *De Agricultura* 75, 2nd century BCE

___

Libum was a simple cake often used as an offering to household gods during Roman religious ceremonies. Its base of fresh cheese and flour creates a dense, moist cake similar to modern cheesecake. While Cato's original recipe doesn't specify serving with honey, most historical sources associate libum with honey, which adds a welcome sweetness to the mild cake.

### Ingredients
- 250g {% include ingredient_link.html name="ricotta" %}  
- 125g whole wheat {% include ingredient_link.html name="flour" %}  
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="egg" %}  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="bay leaves" %}  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %} for serving

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180 C.

2. Thoroughly mix together the ricotta, flour, and eggs along with a pinch of salt. Shape into a round loaf.

3. Lightly grease a small dutch oven with a little olive oil. Lightly coat the bay leaves in olive oil then place to cover the bottom of the dutch oven. Put the loaf on top, and then bake with the lid on for about 1.5 hours, until golden and firm.

4. Once baked, cut into slices, cover in honey, and serve immediately.

### Notes
*Libum* was sometimes used to refer to the sacrificial cakes offered to household spirits, which may explain why Cato included a recipe in his work on agriculture. Cato does not say to serve with honey, but as noted in *The Classical Cookbook* all other ancient authors associate the cake with honey, and it certainly tastes better this way.
