# Patina of Sardines

### Original Latin
*Patina de apua: abuam lauas, ex oleo maceras; in cummana conpones, adicies oleum liquamen uinum; alligas fasciculos rute et origani et subinde fasciculos apababdiabis; cum cocta fuerit proicies fasciculos et piper asperges et inferes.*

### English Translation
Patina of whitebait: Wash the whitebait and marinate in oil. Arrange in an earthenware dish, add oil, fish sauce, and wine. Tie up bundles of rue and oregano and move them around in the dish from time to time. When cooked, remove the bundles, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

—*Apicius*, 4.2.11, c. 4th century CE

### Ingredients
- 5 whole {% include ingredient_link.html name="sardines" %} (about 450g)
- 100 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="oregano" %}
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Place the sardines in a frying pan along with the wine, oil, fish sauce, oregano, and rue. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, or until the sardines are cooked through.
2. Remove the sardines from the frying pan, sprinkle with pepper, and serve with just a little of the cooking liquid.

### Notes
- The original recipe uses *apua* (whitebait or small fish fry), but sardines make an excellent substitute.
- A *patina* in Roman cooking typically referred to a dish cooked in an earthenware vessel, often involving eggs, but in this case it's a simple fish preparation.
- The herbs infuse into the cooking liquid, creating a flavorful broth.
- This simple method of cooking fish would have been common throughout the Mediterranean in Roman times.
