### English Translation
Loins and other fleshy parts: Season sparingly with salt, coriander, and *opos* (asafoetida/silphium juice), then roast until just cooked through. Have ready in a pot a hot broth: one part vinegar, one part oil, two parts sweet wine, a little salt. When it boils, add sprigs of oregano. [The remainder of the text is fragmentary]

—Heidelberg papyrus, c. 300

___

**Claude's intro:** This pork recipe comes from the remarkable Heidelberg papyrus, one of the few surviving culinary texts from the late 3rd/early 4th century CE. Unlike the more famous Apicius cookbook that primarily reflects elite Roman dining, the Heidelberg papyrus represents more everyday cooking traditions. The recipe balances aromatic coriander and pungent asafoetida with a sweet-sour sauce, creating a flavor profile typical of Greco-Roman cuisine. This method of first roasting meat and then finishing it in a flavorful sauce was a common technique that helped enhance and moisten the meat.

### Ingredients
- 1 kg {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} loin
- 1 Tb ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %}
- 1½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- 1½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="salt" %}
- 150 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="sweet wine" %}
- 75 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 75 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 1½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="oregano" %}

### Method
1. Season the pork with coriander, asafoetida and salt. Let stand for at least an hour.
2. Heat oven to 200°C / 400°F. Roast the pork until it reaches an internal temperature of 63°C / 145°F (about 25-35 minutes).
3. While the meat rests, add the wine, olive oil, vinegar, and dried oregano to a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Season with a little salt, and add sugar or extra vinegar if needed to balance.
4. Take the sauce off the heat. Slice the meat and mix with the sauce. Reheat gently for a few minutes, then serve.
