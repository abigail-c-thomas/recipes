# Lentils and Barley

### Original Source
This recipe comes from Galen's treatise "On the Powers of Food" (De Alimentorum Facultatibus), where he discusses beneficial food combinations including hearty grain and legume mixtures.

â€”*Galen*, On the Powers of Food, R5, c. 2nd century CE

**Claude's intro:** This nourishing one-pot meal exemplifies the practical food wisdom of Galen, the influential Greek physician who served Roman emperors. Combining grains and legumes creates a complete protein source, something that Galen understood on a practical level even without modern nutritional science. The herbs included were not just for flavor but served medicinal purposes as well - dill and pennyroyal were believed to aid digestion, while savory helped balance the "humors" of the hearty ingredients. This simple, filling dish would have sustained working people throughout the Roman Empire.

### Ingredients
- 150g red {% include ingredient_link.html name="lentils" %}
- 90g {% include ingredient_link.html name="barley" %}
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="leek" %}, chopped
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="savory" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="dill" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="pennyroyal" %} (substitute mint if unavailable)
- 4 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}

### Method
Add all of the ingredients to a large saucepan along with 1.5L of water. Bring to a boil, then simmer uncovered for 90 minutes, or until cooked and the lentils have become thick. Add more water if needed, and stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

### Notes
Pennyroyal was a common herb in ancient medicine but is rarely used in modern cooking due to safety concerns; fresh mint makes a good substitute. Galen would have prescribed this dish for its balanced nutritional properties, and it represents everyday food rather than elite dining. The long cooking time allows the flavors to meld while breaking down the legumes and grains into a digestible porridge-like consistency.
