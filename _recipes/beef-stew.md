Claude's intro: This remarkably simple beef stew demonstrates the practical side of Roman cooking, where a few high-quality ingredients could be combined to create a satisfying meal. The recipe is unusual in offering multiple alternative ingredients (leeks, quinces, onions, or taro), suggesting a flexibility that would have allowed the dish to be prepared according to seasonal availability or regional preferences. The use of *laser* (asafoetida) provides a distinctive umami flavor that, combined with fish sauce, creates depth without requiring a complex mixture of spices. This adaptable, straightforward approach to cooking meat would have been accessible to Romans of various social classes, not just the elite.

### Ingredients
- 500g diced chuck roast
- 1 large onion, diced, or a small leek, diced
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 300 ml water
- 1/2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- Generous ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Heat olive oil in a small dutch oven until close to smoking. Add the beef and brown.
2. Turn the heat down to moderate and add the onion. Continue frying for about 5 minutes, or until translucent.
3. Add the remaining ingredients to the dutch oven. Bring to a gentle simmer, then place the lid off and cook for an hour, or until the beef is tender.

### Notes
- The recipe is for beef with onion, or leek, or taro, or quince. Any of these variations would be authentic to the original.
- While modern beef stews often include carrots, potatoes, or other vegetables, the Roman version focuses primarily on the meat with just one accompanying vegetable or fruit.
- The simplicity of this recipe highlights the importance of quality ingredients in Roman cooking.
