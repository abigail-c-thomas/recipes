# Pottage with Wine-based Stock

### Original Text
> Aliter: cum iure simplici. pulticulas et iurulium varium isiciatum: aliter: pultes tractogalatae.

"Another [pottage]: with simple stock. Little pottages and varied meat-juice sauce: another: pottage with pasta and milk."

â€”*Apicius*, 5.1.2, c. 4th century CE

This simple grain porridge showcases the Roman approach to cooking semolina. By using a mixture of stock and wine as the cooking liquid, the grain absorbs far more flavor than it would if cooked in plain water.

### Ingredients
- 250 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="stock" %}  
- 250 ml white {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}  
- 100 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="semolina" %}

### Method
1. Put the stock and white wine into a saucepan. Bring to a boil then simmer for about 5 minutes, to allow most of the ethanol in the wine to evaporate. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to below 50 C.

2. Add the semolina to the saucepan, and place the saucepan back on the heat. Cook, constantly stirring, until the mixture becomes a thick polenta. This should only take about 5 minutes. Season with additional salt, if needed, and serve.
