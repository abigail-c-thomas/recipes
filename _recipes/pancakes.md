This simple pancake recipe comes from the writings of Galen, the influential Greek physician who served as personal doctor to several Roman emperors. The recipe demonstrates the basics of Roman cooking with its minimal ingredients, creating a versatile flatbread that could be served with savory or sweet accompaniments.

### Ingredients
- 120 g whole wheat {% include ingredient_link.html name="flour" %}  
- 240 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="water" %}  
- Pinch of {% include ingredient_link.html name="salt" %}  
- 30 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}, plus additional for serving  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}, for frying

### Method
1. Mix the wheat, salt, honey and water together in a mixing bowl, then let rest for 20 minutes.

2. Heat a little olive oil in a pan. Pour some of the batter into the pan to make a thin pancake. Cook for a couple minutes, then flip and cook on the other side. Repeat until the batter is finished, adding more olive oil if needed.

3. Serve the pancakes drizzled with honey.

### Notes
Galen doesn't call for the pancakes to be served with honey, but Archestratus also describes this dish as an Athenian specialty to be served with Attic honey.
