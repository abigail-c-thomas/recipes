1. Rinse the lentils in fresh cold water, then place in a saucepan with about 600 ml water. Bring to a simmer, then add the leeks and coriander leaves and cook until the lentils are soft, about 45 minutes.  

2. In a mortar, grind together the coriander seeds, pennyroyal, asafoetida root, mint, and rue seed. Add the vinegar, honey, fish sauce, wine, and defrutum. Mix well.

3. Add the spice mixture to the lentils along with the olive oil. Stir and taste, adjusting seasoning as required.  

4. Add the cornstarch slurry and allow to thicken for another minute, then serve with a little extra olive oil and pepper drizzled on top.

### Notes
This complex Roman lentil dish showcases the sophisticated use of herbs and spices in ancient Roman cuisine. The recipe features asafoetida (laser/silphium), which was a prized ingredient in Roman cooking. The dish combines savory, sweet, and acidic elements, creating a flavorful and hearty legume preparation.
