**Claude's intro:** This Roman lentil dish from Apicius demonstrates the sophisticated use of herbs and spices in ancient Roman cuisine. It features asafoetida (called laser or silphium by the Romans), which was a prized ingredient often used in legume dishes to aid digestion. The complex blend of aromatic herbs, honey, vinegar, and fish sauce creates a distinctly Roman flavor profile that balances sweet, sour, and savory elements. Lentils were an important staple food in the Roman diet, providing affordable protein and sustenance to people of all social classes.

### Ingredients
- 250g {% include ingredient_link.html name="red lentils" %}  
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="leek" %}, chopped  
- 1 handful of {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} leaves, chopped  
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="pennyroyal" %}  
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}  
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="mint" %}  
- 1 tsp of {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}, chopped  
- 2 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} seeds  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- 3 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}, plus extra for serving  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cornstarch" %}, made into a slurry
- Freshly ground black pepper

### Method

1. Rinse the lentils in fresh cold water, then place in a saucepan with about 600 ml water. Bring to a simmer, then add the leeks and coriander leaves and cook until the lentils are soft, about 45 minutes.  

2. In a mortar, grind together the coriander seeds, pennyroyal, asafoetida root, mint, and rue seed. Add the vinegar, honey, fish sauce, wine, and defrutum. Mix well.

3. Add the spice mixture to the lentils along with the olive oil. Stir and taste, adjusting seasoning as required.  

4. Add the cornstarch slurry and allow to thicken for another minute, then serve with a little extra olive oil and pepper drizzled on top.

### Notes
- Red lentils were chosen for this recipe as they become soft when cooked, though the Romans would have likely used brown lentils
- Pennyroyal can be substituted with extra mint if unavailable
- The original recipe suggests adding "fresh oil" at the end - use your best quality olive oil for this final drizzle
