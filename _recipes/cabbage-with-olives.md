# Cabbage with Olives

### Original Latin
*Aliter cauliculos condies ut supra admisces olibas uirides et simul ferueant.*

### English Translation
Another way to season cabbage: mix with green olives and cook together.

â€”*Apicius*, 3.9.5, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This simple cabbage dish incorporates green olives for a burst of briny flavor that complements the mild cabbage. While the original recipe is extremely brief, it references previous cooking methods and seasonings that would have been applied to this dish as well. The combination of cabbage and olives might seem unusual to modern tastes, but it creates a delightful contrast of flavors and textures. The quick cooking method preserves the integrity of both ingredients while allowing their flavors to meld. This relatively straightforward preparation demonstrates how Roman cooks created variety in their cuisine by combining familiar ingredients in different ways.

### Ingredients
- 500g {% include ingredient_link.html name="cabbage" %}, chopped into thin strips
- 150g green {% include ingredient_link.html name="olives" %}, pitted
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}

### Method
1. Add the green olives and cabbage to a wok or frying pan along with about 100 ml of water. Cook for 5 or so minutes, until the cabbage is tender and the water has evaporated.
2. Add the fish sauce, white wine, olive oil, and cumin to the wok. Cook for a further minute or two until most of the liquid has evaporated.
3. Serve hot.

### Notes
- The original recipe is very brief, simply instructing to add olives to cabbage prepared in the manner described in previous recipes.
- This recipe showcases the Roman fondness for olives, which were a staple of their diet and featured prominently in their cuisine.
- The addition of cumin follows the pattern established in other cabbage recipes in Apicius.
- This quick-cooking method preserves more of the olives' flavor than longer braising would.
