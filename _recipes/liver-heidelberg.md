# Liver (Heidelberg)

### Original Text
*Hπαρ καλὸν‧ τεμὼν ἀναποίει με-
τ᾽ ἐλαίου ἁλὶ, κόρι, θύμῳ, ὀπῳ, ὄξει‧
εἰς ὀβελίσκον‧ ὄπτα θερμὸν καὶ
χρῳ.*

### English Translation
Good liver: slice it and mix with oil, salt, coriander, thyme, *opos* (asafoetida), and vinegar. [Put it] on a skewer, grill it hot and use.

—*Heidelberg Papyrus*, verso, column η, lines 65-68, c. 3rd century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** This simple liver recipe comes from the Heidelberg Papyrus, a remarkable Greek document from the 3rd century CE that contains various culinary recipes among other texts. The recipe showcases the straightforward cooking methods of the time, with a focus on enhancing the natural flavor of liver with aromatic herbs and the distinctive flavor of asafoetida (called *opos* in Greek, which literally means "juice" or "sap"). This preparation method—marinating and then grilling on skewers—remains popular throughout Mediterranean cuisine even today. The Heidelberg Papyrus provides a rare direct glimpse into everyday cooking practices of the late Roman period in the eastern Mediterranean.

### Ingredients
- 500 g pork {% include ingredient_link.html name="liver" %}
- 60 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 60 ml red wine {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- A large handful of chopped {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="thyme" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- A generous amount of {% include ingredient_link.html name="salt" %}

### Method
1. Thinly slice the liver, then combine with the rest of the ingredients and leave to marinate for a few hours.
2. Broil the liver for a few minutes on each side, then serve.

### Notes
- The *opos* in the original Greek recipe refers to a plant resin, most likely silphium or asafoetida.
- This simple preparation showcases the straightforward cooking methods common in Roman times.
- While pork liver is used here, any type of liver (chicken, calf, lamb) would work in this recipe.
- The marinade helps to mellow the strong flavor of the liver.
