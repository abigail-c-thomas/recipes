# Cold Sauce for Boiled Pork

### Original Text

### Ingredients
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="caraway" %} seeds
- 120g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pine nuts" %}
- 30g {% include ingredient_link.html name="mustard" %} seeds
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="dill" %} leaf
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="oregano" %}
- 4 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="date syrup" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method
1. Grind the caraway seeds, pine nuts, and mustard seeds into a fine paste in a mortar and pestle, or food processor.
2. Combine with the rest of the ingredients, and serve.

### Notes
- This should be enough sauce for 500g of boiled pork - use the Boiled Pork in Cold Apician Sauce recipe if you like. The original recipe is, like the previous one, for boiled piglet.
- I have based my modern version on Sally Granger's rendition, see Cooking *Apicius* pg 75.
- The original recipe in Apicius calls for "made-up mustard", probably a mustard-vinegar condiment akin to modern mustard. You should therefore feel free to use yellow mustard, but reduce the vinegar accordingly.
