# Cold Sauce for Boiled Pork

### Original Text
***ius frigidum in porcellum ita facies in elixum**: teres piper careum anetum, origanum modice, nucleos pineos; suffundes acetum liquamen careolam mel, sinape factum; superstillabis oleum, piper asparges et inferes.*

**Cold sauce for boiled suckling pig**: Grind pepper, caraway, dill, a little oregano, pine nuts; pour over vinegar, fish sauce, dates, honey, prepared mustard; drizzle with oil, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

â€”*Apicius*, 8.7.15, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** Cold sauces were a distinctive feature of Roman fine dining, allowing the full flavors of fresh herbs and spices to come through without being altered by heat. This particular sauce combines the earthy flavors of pine nuts and caraway with the bite of mustard and the sweetness of honey and date syrup. The Romans appreciated contrasting temperatures in their cuisine, and pouring this cold, flavorful sauce over hot meat would create a pleasing sensory experience that showcased the cook's sophistication. Such sauces were often prepared in a mortar, which released the essential oils of the spices more effectively than modern chopping.

### Ingredients
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="caraway" %} seeds
- 120g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pine nuts" %}
- 30g {% include ingredient_link.html name="mustard" %} seeds
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="dill" %} leaf
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="oregano" %}
- 4 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="date syrup" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method
1. Grind the caraway seeds, pine nuts, and mustard seeds into a fine paste in a mortar and pestle, or food processor.
2. Combine with the rest of the ingredients, and serve.

### Notes
- This should be enough sauce for 500g of boiled pork - use the Boiled Pork in Cold Apician Sauce recipe if you like. The original recipe is, like the previous one, for boiled piglet.
- I have based my modern version on Sally Granger's rendition, see Cooking *Apicius* pg 75.
- The original recipe in Apicius calls for "made-up mustard", probably a mustard-vinegar condiment akin to modern mustard. You should therefore feel free to use yellow mustard, but reduce the vinegar accordingly.
