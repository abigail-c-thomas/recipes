# Lamb Stew

### Original Latin
*XXVII. agnu simplice: de agno decoriato facies cupadiola, lababis diligenter, mittes in cacabo. adicies oleum liquamen uinum porrum coriandrum cultro concisum. cum bullire ceperit, sepius agitabis et inferes.*

### English Translation
XXVII. Simple lamb: From a skinned lamb, make small cuts of meat, wash them carefully, and put them in a pot. Add oil, fish sauce, wine, leek and coriander cut with a knife. When it begins to boil, stir frequently and serve.

â€”*Vinidarius*, 27, c. 500

Claude's intro: Vinidarius was a late 5th-century Goth who compiled a collection of recipes known as the "Excerpts of Apicius by Vinidarius, an Illustrious Man." This collection preserved simplified versions of earlier Roman recipes during a period when the Western Roman Empire was transitioning to Gothic rule. This simple lamb stew represents the practical cooking style of the period, with straightforward instructions and common ingredients. Unlike earlier complex Apician recipes, Vinidarius' collection often features streamlined methods while maintaining the essential Mediterranean flavor profile of olive oil, fish sauce, wine, and herbs.

### Ingredients
- 800 g thinly sliced {% include ingredient_link.html name="lamb" %}
- 200 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- A handful of {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} leaf, chopped
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="leek" %}, chopped

### Method
Place all of the ingredients into a large frying pan or dutch oven. Bring to a boil, and cook at a high temperature, stirring as needed, until the lamb is cooked and the sauce is entirely reduced.

### Notes
- This recipe offers a much simpler cooking method than the Apicius version, perhaps reflecting practical adaptations over time.
- The lack of thickener creates a different texture, allowing the flavors to concentrate through reduction.
