### Ingredients
- 800 g thinly sliced {% include ingredient_link.html name="lamb" %}
- 200 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- A handful of {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} leaf, chopped
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="leek" %}, chopped

### Method
Place all of the ingredients into a large frying pan or dutch oven. Bring to a boil, and cook at a high temperature, stirring as needed, until the lamb is cooked and the sauce is entirely reduced.

### Notes
- This recipe offers a much simpler cooking method than the Apicius version, perhaps reflecting practical adaptations over time.
- The lack of thickener creates a different texture, allowing the flavors to concentrate through reduction.
