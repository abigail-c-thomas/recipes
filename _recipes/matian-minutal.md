Claude's intro: Minutals were a type of Roman stew or hash made with various ingredients cut into small pieces (the Latin *minutus* means "small"). This particular minutal is named after Matian apples (*mala Matiana*), a variety of apple mentioned by several Roman authors. These apples were named after Gaius Matius, a friend of Julius Caesar and Cicero who was known for his interest in agriculture and gastronomy. They were reportedly sweet apples with a slightly red color. The combination of meat with fruit was characteristic of sophisticated Roman cuisine, balancing savory and sweet flavors.
