# Columella's Alternate Oxyporium

### Original Text
From Columella's *De Re Rustica* (On Agriculture) 12.59f:

> Aliud oxyporum: piperis unciam, ligustici unciam, mentae aridae unciam, uvae passae detractis vinaceis sesquiunciam, mellis optimi sextarium. Pipere tunso, et cribrato melle admiscemus, et sic ceteris tritis utimur.

"Another oxyporium: 1 ounce of pepper, 1 ounce of lovage, 1 ounce of dried mint, 1½ ounces of raisins with seeds removed, and 1 sextarius of the best honey. After grinding and sifting the pepper, we mix it with honey, and then use with the other ground ingredients."

—Columella, *De Re Rustica* 12.59f, 1st century CE

**Claude's intro:** This is a second variation of Columella's *oxyporium*, a spiced digestive aid. This version includes dried mint and raisins, making it slightly sweeter than his first recipe. It would have been served with lettuce or taken medicinally to aid digestion.

### Ingredients
- ½ tsp white {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}  
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="mint" %}  
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}  
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="raisin" %}s, finely chopped  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="red wine vinegar" %}  
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}

### Method
1. Mix all the ingredients together.

2. Serve with lettuce as a salad dressing, or consume alongside lettuce by the teaspoon.

### Notes
Columella's original recipe doesn't specify how to use this mixture, but based on similar recipes from the period, it would have been mixed with vinegar and fish sauce before serving.

The Romans believed in the medicinal properties of these spice mixtures. Mint was considered good for the stomach, lovage was believed to have antispasmodic properties, and pepper was thought to warm the body and aid digestion.

This particular combination of herbs and honey creates a complex sweet, sour, and aromatic flavor profile that would have complemented the bitter greens commonly eaten in ancient Rome.

Romans often made these spice mixtures in bulk and stored them for use throughout the year, which is why Columella's recipe makes a large quantity. This adapted recipe has been scaled down for modern use.
