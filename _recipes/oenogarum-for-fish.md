# Oenogarum for Fish

### Original Text
*Oenogarum in tubera: piper, ligusticum, coriandrum, rutam, liquamen, mel, vinum et oleum modice.*

### English Translation
Wine-fish sauce for sea bream: pepper, lovage, coriander, rue, fish sauce, honey, wine, and a little oil.

—*Apicius*, 10.2.17, c. 4th century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** *Oenogarum* was a popular sauce in Roman cuisine that combined wine with *garum* (fish sauce), creating a rich, umami-flavored condiment. This particular variation for fish includes herbs and honey, resulting in a complex sweet-savory profile that would have complemented the delicate flavor of sea bream beautifully. The combination was so favored in Roman cuisine that variations of *oenogarum* appear throughout Apicius for different types of fish and even meat dishes. This versatile sauce demonstrates the Roman fondness for balancing sweet, sour, savory, and aromatic flavors in their cooking.

### Ingredients
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="passum" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Place all ingredients into a small saucepan, mix together, and gently bring to heat. 
2. Simmer for 1-2 minutes until well combined.
3. If desired, thicken with a little cornstarch mixed with water.
4. Serve drizzled over cooked fish.

### Notes
- *Oenogarum* literally means "wine-fish sauce" and was a fundamental sauce in Roman cooking.
- While the original recipe lists additional herbs, this simplified version captures the essential sweet-savory balance.
- *Passum* was a sweet wine made from partially dried grapes; a sweet dessert wine can be substituted.
- This sauce works particularly well with mild white fish or sea bream as mentioned in the original recipe.
