# Tuna Salad

### Original Latin
*Sarda ita fit: coquitur sarda et exossatur. teritur pipere ligustico timo origano ruta careota melle, et in uasculo ouis incisis. ornatur inpensa: uinum modice acetum defritum et oleum uiridem.*

### English Translation
Bonito is prepared thus: cook the bonito and remove the bones. Grind with pepper, lovage, thyme, oregano, rue, date, and honey, and [serve] in a small vessel with sliced eggs. Garnish with a dressing: a little wine, vinegar, *defrutum* and fresh oil.

—*Apicius*, 9.10.2, c. 4th century CE

### Ingredients
- 200g canned {% include ingredient_link.html name="tuna" %}
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="thyme" %}
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="date syrup" %}
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 boiled {% include ingredient_link.html name="egg" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method
1. Mix the tuna with the herbs, date syrup, and honey. Add ground pepper and salt to taste. 
2. Place into a small serving dish. Slice the boiled egg and place on top to decorate. 
3. Mix the wine, vinegar, *defrutum*, and olive oil together and use to dress the tuna.

### Notes
- This recipe is originally for bonito, but that is hard to find.
- This recipe, and indeed all the bonito recipes in Apicius, have no fish sauce or salt of any kind. My guess is that the bonito was salted, and definitely the recipe tastes better with salt.
- The original Roman dish would have likely used freshly caught bonito that was then cooked and prepared, while the modern version uses canned tuna for convenience.
