# Parthian Chicken

### Original Text
***pullum Particum**: pullum aperies a naui et in quadrato ornas. teres piper ligusticum carei modicum, suffunde liquamen, uino temperas. componis in cumana pullum et condituram super pullum facies. laser uiuum in tepida dissoluis, et in pullum mittis simul et quoques, piper aspersum inferes.*

**Parthian chicken**: Open the chicken from the breast and arrange it in a square. Grind pepper, lovage, and a little caraway. Pour in fish sauce, mix with wine. Place the chicken in an earthenware pot and pour the sauce over it. Dissolve fresh laser (asafoetida) in warm water and pour it over the chicken, then cook everything together. Sprinkle with pepper and serve.

—*Apicius*, 6.8.3, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This exotic dish gets its name from the Parthian Empire, Rome's great eastern rival. The aromatic spices and distinctive use of asafoetida (laser) reflect the eastern influences in Roman cuisine that came via the spice trade routes.

This dish appears to be named after Parthia. This could be because it is stylistically similar to a Parthian dish, though lovage and caraway both are distinctly Roman ingredients this seems unlikely. Instead the dish may be named because of its prominent use of asafoetida, known in Latin as Parthian *laser* to distinguish from *silphium*, which was called Cyrenaican *laser*.

### Ingredients
- 1 whole {% include ingredient_link.html name="chicken" %}
- 300 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}
- 45 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %} leaf
- 1½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="caraway" %} seed
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C / 350 F.
2. Quarter the chicken by first removing the backbone by cutting with a sharp knife or kitchen shears, then separate the breasts from the thighs and legs. Arrange the chicken pieces.
3. Dry-fry the caraway seeds, then grind in a mortar and pestle. Combine with wine, fish sauce, lovage, and asafoetida, along with a generous amount of ground black pepper.
4. Place the chicken in a casserole dish, skin side up. Pour the sauce over the chicken, then place in the oven uncovered and bake for 50 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
5. Once the chicken is cooked, remove from the oven, sprinkle with extra black pepper, and serve.

### Notes
- Using bone-in, skin-on, chicken thighs can be a convenient alternative to quartering a whole chicken. Substitute 6 chicken thighs for a whole chicken.
- *Apicius* 6.8.6, for chicken in *laser* sauce, is an almost identical recipe but lacks the caraway seeds used here. So feel free to omit the caraway seeds if you don't have any, or dislike them.
