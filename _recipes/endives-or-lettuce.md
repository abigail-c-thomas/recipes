# Endives or Lettuce

### Original Text
> Intuba ex liquamine et oleo modico medere cepa concisa. Pro lactucis vero hieme intibe ex embammate vel melle et aceto acri.

"Endives with fish sauce and a little oil, with chopped onion. In winter, endives can be used instead of lettuce, with sauce or honey and sharp vinegar."

â€”*Apicius*, *De Re Coquinaria* 3.18.1, 4th-5th century CE

___

This simple Roman salad features crisp endives or lettuce with a light dressing of fish sauce and olive oil. The addition of thinly sliced onions adds pungency and crunch to the fresh greens.

### Ingredients
- Head {% include ingredient_link.html name="lettuce" %} (or an {% include ingredient_link.html name="endive" %})  
- Half of a small white {% include ingredient_link.html name="onion" %}, thinly sliced  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}

### Method
1. Wash and dry the lettuce or endive leaves, and break into large bite-size pieces into a salad bowl.

2. Add the thinly sliced onion.

3. Drizzle with fish sauce and olive oil, toss, and serve.

### Notes
The recipe specifically mentions that endives are a good substitute for lettuce in winter, showing the Romans' awareness of seasonal availability of ingredients. Though endives can be harder to find in some regions today, either vegetable works well in this simple preparation.

Romans typically began their meals with raw vegetables to stimulate the appetite. This salad would have been served as a *gustatio* or appetizer course, before the main dishes.

The original recipe mentions *embamma*, which was a sauce made from various ingredients. In winter, it suggests using either this sauce or a combination of honey and sharp vinegar with the endives.
