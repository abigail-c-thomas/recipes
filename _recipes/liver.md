# Liver

### Original Greek
*Hπαρ καλὸν‧ τεμὼν ἀναποίει μετ᾽ ἐλαίου ἁλὶ, κόρι, θύμῳ, ὀπῳ, ὄξει‧ εἰς ὀβελίσκον‧ ὄπτα θερμὸν καὶ χρῳ.*

### English Translation
Good liver: slice it and mix with oil, salt, coriander, thyme, *opos*, and vinegar. [Put it] on a skewer, grill it hot and use.

—*Heidelberg Papyrus*, verso, column η, lines 65-68, c. 3rd century CE

- The *opos* in the original Greek recipe refers to a plant resin, most likely silphium or asafoetida.
- This simple preparation showcases the straightforward cooking methods common in Roman times.
- While pork liver is used here, any type of liver (chicken, calf, lamb) would work in this recipe.
- The marinade helps to mellow the strong flavor of the liver.
