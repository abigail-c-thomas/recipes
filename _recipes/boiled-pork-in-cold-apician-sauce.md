# Boiled Pork in Cold Apician Sauce

### Original Text
***porcellum elixum calidum iure frigido crudo Apiciano**: adicies in mortarium piper ligusticum coriandri semen mentam rutam, fricabis; suffundes liquamen, adicies mel uinum et liquamine \<temperabis\>. porcellum elixum feruentem sauano mundo siccatum perfundes et inferes.*

**Boiled suckling pig hot with cold raw Apician sauce**: Put in a mortar pepper, lovage, coriander seed, mint, rue, and pound; pour over fish sauce, add honey and wine and mix with fish sauce. Pour over the boiled hot suckling pig dried with a clean cloth and serve.

â€”*Apicius*, 8.7.6, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This recipe showcases one of the distinctive "signature" sauces of Apicius, prepared cold and poured over hot meat to create a pleasing temperature contrast. The combination of fragrant herbs with sweet honey and tangy wine was a hallmark of refined Roman cuisine. Such cold sauces allowed the complex flavors of the herbs and spices to remain fresh and vibrant, rather than being dulled by heating. This preparation would have been considered elegant dining, particularly since the original calls for suckling pig, a luxury ingredient in ancient Rome.

### Ingredients
- 1 kg meat from {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} shoulder
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 2 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %} leaf
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- 3 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="mint" %}
- 3 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} seed, ground
- 200 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 50 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}

### Method
1. Boil the pork in salted water for about 1.5 hrs, until cooked through.
2. Once the pork is cooked, prepare the sauce by mixing together all of the remaining ingredients.
3. Remove the cooked pork from the water and wipe dry with a paper towel. Dice or shred the meat in a serving dish, pour on the cold sauce, and serve.

### Notes
- This is one of the few recipes attributed to Apicius within Apicius. Another, 6.7, calls for an almost identical cold sauce for boiled goose.
- The recipe is originally for a whole piglet which had not yet been weaned.
- If you like, you can boil barley with the pork as a side dish. Boiling barley with meat or broth was a common classical practice. If doing so, instead of salt you can add a bit of fish sauce to the cooking liquid, along with peppercorns and bay leaves for flavour.
