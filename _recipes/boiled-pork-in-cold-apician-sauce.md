### Ingredients
- 1 kg meat from {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} shoulder
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 2 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %} leaf
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- 3 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="mint" %}
- 3 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} seed, ground
- 200 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 50 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}

### Method
1. Boil the pork in salted water for about 1.5 hrs, until cooked through.
2. Once the pork is cooked, prepare the sauce by mixing together all of the remaining ingredients.
3. Remove the cooked pork from the water and wipe dry with a paper towel. Dice or shred the meat in a serving dish, pour on the cold sauce, and serve.

### Notes
- This is one of the few recipes attributed to Apicius within Apicius. Another, 6.7, calls for an almost identical cold sauce for boiled goose.
- The recipe is originally for a whole piglet which had not yet been weaned.
- If you like, you can boil barley with the pork as a side dish. Boiling barley with meat or broth was a common classical practice. If doing so, instead of salt you can add a bit of fish sauce to the cooking liquid, along with peppercorns and bay leaves for flavour.
