# Leafy Greens Salad

### Original Text
*Herbae rusticae: liquamine oleo aceto a manu vel in patina piper cumino bacis lentisci.*

___

**Claude's intro:** This simple Roman salad dressing showcases the fundamental flavors of Mediterranean cuisine. The combination of fish sauce (liquamen), olive oil, and vinegar forms the basis of many ancient Roman dressings, much like modern vinaigrettes. Romans enjoyed a variety of fresh greens dressed with this distinctive combination, appreciating both the flavor and the health benefits attributed to raw vegetables.

### Ingredients
- Head {% include ingredient_link.html name="lettuce" %}, {% include ingredient_link.html name="rocket" %}, {% include ingredient_link.html name="endive" %}s, {% include ingredient_link.html name="chicory" %}, or other leafy greens  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="red wine vinegar" %}
- Freshly ground black {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %} (optional)
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %} (optional)

### Method
1. Wash and dry the lettuce leaves, and break into large bite-size pieces into a salad bowl.

2. Drizzle with olive oil, fish sauce, and vinegar, and serve.

3. If desired, sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of ground cumin before serving.

### Notes
Galen, the famous Greek physician of the 2nd century CE, mentioned that people commonly ate boiled lettuce with this same combination of olive oil, fish sauce, and vinegar.

Lettuce and rocket were a popular combination in ancient Rome, as noted by both Pliny the Elder and Galen. Lettuce was considered cooling and was thought to have sedative properties, while rocket was considered warming and an aphrodisiac, so the two were believed to balance each other out.

The original recipe mentions mastic berries (bacis lentisci), which are rarely available today. These would have added a piney, resinous flavor to the salad.
