### Ingredients
- 1.2 kg rack of {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} ribs
- 50 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 50 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="red wine vinegar" %}
- 50 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 325°F / 165°C. Place the pork ribs into a roast tray and cook for 1h 20m, or until cooked through. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly, then cut into individual ribs.
2. Place the ribs into a wok or large fry pan, and add the fish sauce, red wine vinegar, olive oil, and 50 ml of water. Turn the heat to high and fry vigorously for 5 minutes, or until the liquid has almost entirely evaporated. Serve the ribs with a little of the cooking liquid.
