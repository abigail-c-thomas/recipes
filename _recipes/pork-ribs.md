# Pork Ribs *Ofellae*

### Original Latin
**aliter ofelle**: recte friguntur ut pene ossa rodantur. liquaminis summi ciatum, aquae ciatum, aceti ciatum, olei ciatum. simul mixtis et inmissis in patellam fictilem frigis et inferes.

### English Translation
**Another way for ofellae**: Fry them properly until the bones can almost be gnawed. [Take] one cup of the best fish sauce, one cup of water, one cup of vinegar, one cup of oil. Mix everything together and put it in an earthenware pan, fry and serve.

—*Apicius*, 7.4.4, c. 350

Claude's intro: *Ofellae* were a versatile category of meat dishes in Roman cuisine, typically consisting of small cuts of meat that were either fried or roasted. The term could refer to various cuts, including ribs, chops, or small pieces of meat. This particular recipe provides instructions for cooking meat until it's nearly falling off the bone, then finishing it in a flavorful liquid mixture. Unlike some of the more complex Apician recipes, this one features a simple combination of fish sauce, vinegar, and oil, allowing the natural flavor of the pork to shine through while adding a tangy, savory coating.

### Ingredients
- 1.2 kg rack of {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} ribs
- 50 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 50 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="red wine vinegar" %}
- 50 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 325°F / 165°C. Place the pork ribs into a roast tray and cook for 1h 20m, or until cooked through. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly, then cut into individual ribs.
2. Place the ribs into a wok or large fry pan, and add the fish sauce, red wine vinegar, olive oil, and 50 ml of water. Turn the heat to high and fry vigorously for 5 minutes, or until the liquid has almost entirely evaporated. Serve the ribs with a little of the cooking liquid.
