**Spiced wine**: Recipe for special spiced wine: Put 15 pounds of honey in a bronze vessel, first adding two sextarii of wine, so that the wine reduces while the honey cooks. Heat it on a slow fire of dry wood, stirring with a reed while it cooks. If it begins to boil over, sprinkle it with wine to cool it down, or remove it from the fire until it settles. When it has cooled, light the fire again. Do this a second and third time, then remove it from the heat and skim it the next day. Then add four ounces of ground pepper, 3 scruples of mastic, 1 drachm each of *folium* and saffron, 5 roasted date stones, and the dates themselves softened in wine, first sprinkling them with wine according to their quantity, so that a smooth mixture is obtained. When all these ingredients are ready, add 18 sextarii of mild wine; finally, add two thousand coals.

—*Apicius*, 1.1, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This elaborate recipe for *conditum paradoxum* (extraordinary spiced wine) demonstrates the Roman appreciation for complex flavored wines. Opening the Apicius cookbook, this recipe showcases the Roman talent for combining unexpected ingredients—honey, pepper, saffron, and dates—to create a sophisticated beverage. The meticulous cooking process described in the original text highlights the importance Romans placed on proper preparation techniques. While modern mulled wines typically focus on warming spices like cinnamon and cloves, this ancient version's inclusion of black pepper and mastic creates a distinctly Roman flavor profile that balances sweet, spicy, and aromatic elements. This would have been served as both a pleasurable drink and a digestive aid.
