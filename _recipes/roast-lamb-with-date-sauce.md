### Ingredients
- 2.5 kg leg of {% include ingredient_link.html name="lamb" %}
- 2 {% include ingredient_link.html name="onion" %}s
- 3 {% include ingredient_link.html name="carrot" %}s
- 2 {% include ingredient_link.html name="parsnip" %}s
- 12 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}corns, crushed
- Pinch of {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- 300 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="milk" %}
- 70 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 70 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 150 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 100 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 4 {% include ingredient_link.html name="dates" %}, softened in boiling water and pounded into a paste
- 1 Tb cornstarch, made into slurry

### Method
1. Take the lamb out of the fridge one hour before roasting.
2. Preheat the oven to 240°C/475°F.
3. Wedge the onions, and chop the carrots and parsnips into bite-sized pieces, place on a roasting tray and toss with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper.
4. Place the leg of lamb on top of the vegetables, then roast for 20 minutes. Turn the oven down to 200°C/400°F and roast for a further hour, or until the internal temperature comes to 53°C/127°F.
5. Transfer the lamb and vegetables to a plate, loosely covered in foil, and allow to rest for 20 minutes while you prepare the sauce. Reserve the juices and drippings from the roast.
6. Place all of the sauce ingredients, except for the cornstarch slurry, into a saucepan, along with a few tablespoons of the reserved meat juices. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired. Gently heat until it just begins to simmer, then thicken with the cornstarch.
7. Carve the lamb into thick slices, reheating it and the vegetables if desired. Pour over the sauce and serve.
