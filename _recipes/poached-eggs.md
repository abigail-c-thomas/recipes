â€”Galen, *On the Powers of Food* R17

___

**Claude's intro:** This simple egg preparation comes from Galen, the famous Greek physician whose medical writings had enormous influence well into the Renaissance. Unlike modern poached eggs cooked directly in water, this method steams the eggs in a flavorful mixture of wine, fish sauce, and olive oil, creating a dish that was considered both nutritious and easy to digest according to ancient medical theory. Galen often discussed food preparation in the context of health benefits, making this more than just a recipe but part of his broader approach to medicine and diet.
