### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 200 C/400 F. Lightly coat the pork in olive oil, place in a roasting tin, and roast for about 45 minutes, or until the exterior is browned. Remove the pork from the oven and allow to cool.  
2. Dice the pork into bite-sized pieces, and then add both to a large pot along with the leak, coriander leaf, wine, stock fish sauce, and olive oil. Bring to a simmer, then put a lid on and cook for 30 minutes.  
3. Add the pepper, lovage, oregano, passum, and cornstarch. Heat and stir until thickened. Serve sprinkled with pepper.
