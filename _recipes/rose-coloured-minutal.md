# Rose-coloured Minutal

### Original Latin
**aliter minutal dulce**: adicies \<in\> caccabum liquamen uinum oleum cocturam, porrum et coriandrum concisum. esicia minuta, spatulam porcinam coctam tessellatim concisam et in eundem caccabum inmities. dum coquitur teres piper ligusticum origanum; ius de suo sibi uino et passo temperabis. facies ut ferueat; cum ferbuerit tractam confringes et ex ea obligas; piper aspargis et inferes.

**minutal ex rosis**: eodem iure supra scripto sed passum plus adicies.

### English Translation
**Another sweet minutal**: Add to a pot fish sauce, wine, oil, cooking broth, chopped leek and coriander. [Add] small meatballs, cooked pork shoulder cut into cubes and put them in the same pot. While it cooks, grind pepper, lovage, oregano; mix the cooking juices with wine and *passum*. Bring to a boil; when it boils break pastry and use it to thicken; sprinkle with pepper and serve.

**Minutal of roses**: [Prepare] with the same sauce as written above, but add more *passum*.

â€”*Apicius*, 4.3.7b-8, c. 350

Claude's intro: This recipe refers back to the previous recipe (4.3.7) for a sweet minutal, which calls for liquamen (fish sauce), wine, olive oil, cooking broth, pork shoulder, leeks, and coriander, with a sauce of pepper, lovage, oregano, and wine. The "rose" in the name refers not to actual roses but to the pink or rose-colored appearance of the dish, which comes from the addition of extra *passum* (a sweet wine made from dried grapes). *Passum* would have given the dish both a sweeter flavor and a deeper reddish hue. Roman dishes were often named for their color, and this rose-colored minutal would have been both visually appealing and flavorful.

### Ingredients
- 1 kg {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} shoulder, diced  
- 500 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="beef" %} mince  
- 500 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}  
- 500 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="stock" %}  
- 45 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="leek" %}, chopped  
- A handful of {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} leaf, chopped  
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}  
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}  
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="oregano" %}  
- 250 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="passum" %}  
- 4 Tb cornstarch, prepared into a slurry

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 200 C/400 F. Lightly coat the pork in olive oil, place in a roasting tin, and roast for about 45 minutes, or until the exterior is browned. Remove the pork from the oven and allow to cool.  
2. Dice the pork into bite-sized pieces, and then add both to a large pot along with the leak, coriander leaf, wine, stock fish sauce, and olive oil. Bring to a simmer, then put a lid on and cook for 30 minutes.  
3. Add the pepper, lovage, oregano, passum, and cornstarch. Heat and stir until thickened. Serve sprinkled with pepper.
