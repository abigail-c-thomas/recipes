# Gourd with Spiced Sauce

### Original Latin
*Cucurbitas: callosiores reddes gustum ad cucurbitas: coctas expressas in patinam conpones. adicies in mortarium pipere cuminum silfi modice (id est laseris radicem), rutam modicum; liquamine et aceto temperabis; mittes defreto modicum ut coloretur; ius exinanies in patenam. cum ferbuerit iterum ac tertio, depones et piper minutum asparges.*

### English Translation
"Gourds: To make tougher gourds tastier: After cooking and draining them, arrange in a pan. Add to a mortar pepper, cumin, a little silphium (that is, laser root), and a little rue; mix with fish sauce and vinegar; add a little reduced wine for color; pour the sauce into the pan. When it has boiled for a second and third time, remove and sprinkle with ground pepper."

—*Apicius*, 3.4.1, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This recipe transforms simple squash or gourd with an aromatic spiced sauce. The Romans enjoyed gourds, which were different from modern varieties but similar to summer squash in texture and taste. This dish balances the mild flavor of the gourd with a tangy, savory sauce.

### Ingredients
- 500 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="squash" %} (or gourd, if you can find it)  
- ½ tsp ground black {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}  
- 1 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}  
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}  
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}  
- 3 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="red wine vinegar" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %} (reduced grape must)

### Method
1. Cut the squash into large pieces then boil until *al dente*. Remove from the water and place in a dutch oven.

2. Mix the remaining ingredients together, then pour over the squash. Bring to a simmer and cook for a few minutes, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

### Notes
The original recipe calls for "silfi" or laser root, which refers to silphium, a now-extinct plant that was highly prized in Roman cooking. Asafoetida makes the best modern substitute, providing a similar pungent, savory flavor.

"Defrutum" was a Roman reduction of grape must (unfermented grape juice) cooked down to a syrup. For a modern substitute, you can use a tablespoon of reduced balsamic vinegar, a sweet wine reduction, or even a mixture of grape juice concentrate and honey.

Rue is a bitter herb used in Roman cooking but now rarely used in cuisine. If unavailable, you can substitute with a small amount of rosemary, though the flavor profile will be different.

This method of cooking vegetables - boiling first, then finishing in a flavorful sauce - was common in Roman cuisine and appears in many recipes across Apicius' cookbook.
