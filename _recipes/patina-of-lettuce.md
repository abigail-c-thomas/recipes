Claude's intro: *Patinae* were a characteristic dish in Roman cuisine, essentially baked egg-based mixtures similar to modern frittatas or custards. They could contain a wide variety of ingredients, from vegetables to meat to fish, and were often served as part of the main meal. This particular patina uses lettuce, which Romans commonly consumed both raw and cooked. While modern diners primarily eat lettuce raw in salads, Romans appreciated its versatility when cooked. The use of *caroenum* (reduced wine must) and fish sauce adds depth and umami to what might otherwise be a simple dish.
