# Salted Shoulder of Pork

### Original Latin
*Petasonem ex musteis: petasonem elixas cum bilibre ordei et caricis XXV. cum elixatus fuerit, decarnas et aruillam illius candenti uatillo uris et melle contingis. quod melius, missum in furnum, melle oblinas. cum colorauerit, mittis in caccabum passum piper fasciculum rute merum, temperas; cum fuerit temperatum, dimidium in petasonem perfundis et aliam partem piperati, buccellas musteorum fractas perfundis. cum sorbuerint, quod mustei recusauerint petasoni refundis.*

### English Translation
Salted pork shoulder with must cakes: boil a salted pork shoulder with two pounds of barley and 25 dried figs. When it is boiled, remove the meat and burn the fat with a hot shovel and cover with honey. For better results, place it in the oven and coat with honey. When it has colored, put in a pot *passum*, pepper, a bundle of rue, and wine; mix well. When it is mixed, pour half over the pork shoulder and the other part of the pepper sauce over broken pieces of must cakes. When they have absorbed it, pour whatever the must cakes have not absorbed back over the pork shoulder.

—*Apicius*, 7.9.3, c. 4th century CE

Claude's intro: This elaborate recipe showcases the Roman fondness for multi-stage cooking processes and sweet-savory combinations. The salted pork shoulder, a staple of Roman cuisine, is first boiled with barley and figs to infuse it with sweetness while drawing out some of its saltiness. The finishing of the fat with a hot shovel would have created a caramelized exterior, while the honey coating added before baking would further enhance this effect. The complex sauce combines wine, *passum* (raisin wine), and aromatic rue to balance the rich meat. Particularly interesting is the use of *mustacei* (must cakes made with grape must), which soak up part of the sauce before it's returned to the meat - a technique showing the Romans' sophisticated understanding of flavor absorption and concentration. This dish represents the height of Roman culinary refinement, combining multiple cooking methods and carefully balanced flavors.

### Ingredients
- 700 g gammon or smoked ham
- 250 g pearl barley
- 10 dried figs
- 100 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 250 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 250 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="passum" %}
- 2 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 6 *mustacei* (must cakes, see recipe)

### Method
1. Place the meat in a large saucepan with the barley and figs. Add water to cover. Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 hour.
2. Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C. Remove the meat from the saucepan, and place on a baking tray, and allow to cool for a few minutes. Then cover with the honey and place in the oven for 30 minutes.
3. While the meat is in the oven, prepare the sauce by combining the white wine, *passum*, rue, pepper, and *liquamen* in a bowl. Mix together and adjust as desired.
4. Once the pork is cooked, carve and plate with the mustacei broken in half, then pour over the sauce. Serve along with the barley and figs.

### Notes
- Recipe 7.9.2 is similar and suggests using plain bread (though must cakes are apparently better). Rather than specify the sauce, it suggests using *caroenum* or spiced wine.
- The must cakes (*mustacei*) were made from flour, grape must, anise, cumin, lard, and cheese, formed into small cakes and baked on bay leaves.
- If must cakes aren't available, any dense, slightly sweet bread can be substituted.
