*Pullum elixum cum cucurbitis elixis: iure supra scripto, addito sinape, perfundis et inferes.*

Boiled chicken in its own sauce: Grind pepper, cumin, a little thyme, fennel seed, mint, rue, and laser root. Pour in vinegar, add dates, and grind. Mix with honey, vinegar, fish sauce, and oil. Cool the chicken and serve it dried, pouring the sauce over it.

**Claude's intro:** This recipe combines tender boiled chicken with butternut squash (standing in for the Roman gourd) in a complex sauce featuring multiple herbs and spices. The sauce combines sweet elements (dates, honey) with savory (fish sauce) and tangy (vinegar) components, creating a balanced flavor profile typical of Roman cuisine.

### Ingredients
- 4 chicken thighs
- 600 g butternut squash, cut into large pieces
- 1 tsp cumin
- ½ tsp thyme
- ½ tsp fennel seed, ground
- 1 tsp mint
- ½ tsp rue
- ½ tsp asafoetida
- 8 dates, finely minced
- 60 g honey
- 80 ml vinegar
- 30 ml fish sauce
- 15 ml olive oil
- A little mustard (optional)
- Ground pepper

### Method
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the chicken thighs and simmer for 10 minutes, then add the butternut squash and simmer for another 15, or until both chicken and squash are cooked. Remove from the water and dry.
2. Mix all of the sauce ingredients in a bowl. Plate the chicken and squash, then drizzle with the sauce, and serve.

### Notes
This recipe refers to a sauce mentioned earlier in the text. Based on similar recipes in Apicius, I've recreated a sauce that would be appropriate for this dish, combining the typical Roman flavors of sweet, savory, and tangy elements.

This same sauce can also be served with taro, as suggested in Apicius 6.8.10.
