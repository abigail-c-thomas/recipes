*Pullum elixum cum cucurbitis elixis: iure supra scripto, addito sinape, perfundis et inferes.*

### English Translation
Boiled chicken in its own sauce: Grind pepper, cumin, a little thyme, fennel seed, mint, rue, and *laser* root. Pour in vinegar, add dates, and grind. Mix with honey, vinegar, fish sauce, and oil. Cool the chicken and serve it dried, pouring the sauce over it.

Boiled chicken with boiled gourds: Pour over it the sauce written above, with the addition of mustard, and serve.

**Claude's intro:** This recipe combines tender boiled chicken with butternut squash (standing in for the Roman gourd) in a complex sauce featuring multiple herbs and spices. The sauce highlights the Roman love of layered flavors, combining sweet elements (dates, honey) with savory (fish sauce) and tangy (vinegar) components. The addition of mustard specifically for the gourd version shows how Romans would subtly adapt sauces to complement different ingredients. This dish exemplifies the practical approach of Roman cooking, where a base sauce could be modified slightly for different applications.

### Ingredients
- 4 {% include ingredient_link.html name="chicken" %} thighs
- 600 g butternut squash, cut into large pieces
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="thyme" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fennel seed" %}, ground
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="mint" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- 8 {% include ingredient_link.html name="dates" %}, finely minced
- 60 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 80 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 15 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- A little {% include ingredient_link.html name="mustard" %} (optional)
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the chicken thighs and simmer for 10 minutes, then add the butternut squash and simmer for another 15, or until both chicken and squash are cooked. Remove from the water and dry.
2. Mix all of the sauce ingredients in a bowl. Plate the chicken and squash, then drizzle with the sauce, and serve.

### Notes
- The "gourd" in the original recipe would have been one of several varieties of Cucurbita grown in Roman gardens; butternut squash makes an excellent modern substitute.
- The original recipe suggests cooling the chicken before serving with the sauce, but this adaptation serves it warm for modern tastes.
- This same sauce can also be served with taro, as suggested in Apicius 6.8.10.
- *Laser* refers to asafoetida, which Romans used as a substitute for the extinct silphium plant.
