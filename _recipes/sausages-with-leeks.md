### Ingredients
- 500g fatty {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} shoulder, minced
- 1 large {% include ingredient_link.html name="leek" %}
- 50g {% include ingredient_link.html name="bulgur wheat" %}
- 2½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}corns
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %} leaf
- 3 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}
- 50g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pine nuts" %}, crushed
- 45ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- Sausage skins

### Method
1. Finely chop the white part of the leek, and discard the greens (or save for another use)
2. Add the chopped leek to a pan along with the bulgur wheat and about 150 ml of water. Bring to the boil and then simmer for a few minutes. Strain the leak and bulgur mixture and then turn out onto a baking tray to cool.
3. In a large mortar and pestle, first crush the peppercorns and then add and crush the pine nuts.
4. Combine all the ingredients (except the sausage skins) together in a mixing bowl. Use a sausage stuffer to stuff the sausage skins.
5. Once ready to cook the sausages, place in a pan of water and bring to a simmer, cooking for about 15 minutes or until cooked through. If you like, you can then broil them briefly to give them some color.
