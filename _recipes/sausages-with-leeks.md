# Sausages with Leeks

### Original Text
**aliter**: alicam purgas et cum liquamine intestini et albamine porri concisi minutatim simul elixas. elixa tolles, pinguedinem concides, et copadia pulpe in se omnia conmisces. teres piper ligusticum oua tria; haec omnia in mortario permisces cum nucleis et piper integro. liquamen suffundes, intestina imples, elixas et subassas, uel elixa tantum appones.

### English Translation
**Another way**: Clean *alica* and boil it with fish sauce and the white part of finely chopped leek. When boiled, remove it, cut up the fat, and mix together with pieces of meat. Grind pepper, lovage, and three eggs; mix all these in the mortar with pine nuts and whole peppercorns. Pour in fish sauce, fill the intestines, boil and then roast, or simply boil and serve.

—*Apicius*, 2.5.3, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** Leeks were an important and popular vegetable in Roman cuisine, used in a wide variety of dishes from soups to sauces to sausages like this one. The Romans distinguished between the white part (album) and the green part of the leek, often using them differently. This sausage recipe specifically calls for the white part, which would have provided a milder flavor. Leeks were believed to have medicinal properties as well as culinary uses - Nero reportedly ate leeks every month to improve his voice. This sausage recipe combines the leeks with *alica* (a type of wheat), pine nuts, and spices to create a complex and flavorful dish that showcases the sophisticated flavor combinations typical of Roman cooking.

### Ingredients
- 500g fatty {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} shoulder, minced
- 1 large {% include ingredient_link.html name="leek" %}
- 50g {% include ingredient_link.html name="bulgur wheat" %}
- 2½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}corns
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %} leaf
- 3 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}
- 50g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pine nuts" %}, crushed
- 45ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- Sausage skins

### Method
1. Finely chop the white part of the leek, and discard the greens (or save for another use)
2. Add the chopped leek to a pan along with the bulgur wheat and about 150 ml of water. Bring to the boil and then simmer for a few minutes. Strain the leak and bulgur mixture and then turn out onto a baking tray to cool.
3. In a large mortar and pestle, first crush the peppercorns and then add and crush the pine nuts.
4. Combine all the ingredients (except the sausage skins) together in a mixing bowl. Use a sausage stuffer to stuff the sausage skins.
5. Once ready to cook the sausages, place in a pan of water and bring to a simmer, cooking for about 15 minutes or until cooked through. If you like, you can then broil them briefly to give them some color.
