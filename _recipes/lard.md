# Lard

### Original Text
*Laridi coctura: tectum aqua cum multo aneto coques, oleum modicum distillabis et modicum salis.*

### English Translation
Cooking lard: Cover with water and cook with plenty of dill, drizzle with a little oil and a little salt.

â€”*Apicius*, 7.9.4, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This remarkably simple preparation from Apicius demonstrates that not all Roman dishes were complex or required numerous ingredients. In a cuisine where pork fat was a prized ingredient and cooking medium, this basic method of preparing lard shows how Romans approached the enhancement of even the most basic ingredients. The use of dill to flavor the lard during cooking would have imparted a subtle herbal note, while the final drizzle of olive oil and sprinkling of salt would create a more complex flavor profile. While modern diners might not consider lard a dish in itself, for Romans, this simple preparation would have been appreciated as a valuable addition to their table, either as a spread for bread or as a component in other dishes.

### Ingredients
- 200 g lardo or salted pork fat
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="dill" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="Salt" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="Olive oil" %}

### Method
Boil the lard in water with dill for 5 to 10 minutes, until soft. Remove from the water and slice. Drizzle with a little olive oil and salt, then serve.

### Notes
- This simple preparation would have been served with bread as an appetizer or as part of a larger meal.
- The boiling process helps remove excess saltiness from cured lard and softens the texture.
- Fresh dill can be used instead of dried for a more pronounced flavor.
