# Cheese Patina

### Original Text
*tiropatina: accipies lac, aduersus quod patinam estimabis, temperabis lac cum melle quasi ad lactantia, oua quinque ad sextarium mittis, si ad eminam, oua tria. in lacte dissoluis ita ut unum corpus facias, in cumana colas et igni lento coques. cum duxerit ad se, piper adspargis et inferes.*

### English Translation
Cheese patina: Take milk according to the size of the dish you wish to make. Mix the milk with honey to the consistency of milk custard. Add five eggs per sextarius [~500ml], or three eggs for a hemina [~250ml]. Dissolve in the milk so that it makes a unified mixture, pour into an earthenware dish and cook over a low heat. When it has set, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

â€”*Apicius*, 7.11.7, c. 4th century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** This ancient Roman custard is a sweet dish that showcases the Roman love of contrasting flavors - in this case, the sweetness of honey with the surprising kick of black pepper. Unlike modern custards, Roman *patinae* were often baked in shallow dishes rather than being stovetop preparations. The name *tiropatinam* combines the Greek word for cheese (*tyros*) with the Latin word for dish (*patina*), though interestingly this recipe doesn't actually include cheese, suggesting it may have evolved from a cheese-based dish.

### Ingredients
- 5 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}
- 540 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="milk" %}
- 100 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 160C/300F.
2. Whisk together the eggs, milk, and honey until smooth.
3. Pour the egg mixture through a sieve into a baking dish, or alternatively, into 4 individual ramekins.
4. Place the baking dish into the oven and bake for about 40 minutes, or until the custard has just set.
5. Remove from the oven. Serve sprinkled with pepper and, if desired, with additional honey drizzled on top.

### Notes
Despite its name suggesting a cheese dish, this Roman custard doesn't contain cheese. The contrast of sweet honey with black pepper is characteristic of Roman cuisine, which often combined flavors in ways unfamiliar to modern palates.
