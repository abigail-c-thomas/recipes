### English Translation
**Wine-cooked piglet**: Pre-cook the piglet and prepare it. Add to a pot oil, fish sauce, wine, water; bind a bundle of leek and coriander; halfway through cooking, color with reduced wine. Add to a mortar pepper, lovage, caraway, oregano, celery seed, asafoetida root, and grind; moisten with fish sauce, its own juice; mix with wine and *passum*. Empty into the pot, bring to a boil; when it boils thicken with starch. Pour over the piglet arranged in a dish, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

—*Apicius*, 8.7.11, c. 350

Claude's intro: This recipe is named after Marcus Cornelius Fronto, who was a prominent Roman grammarian, rhetorician, and advocate who lived during the 2nd century CE. He was a tutor to future emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. This piglet recipe is cooked in wine (hence "oenococtum" - wine-cooked) and features a rich sauce enhanced with defrutum (reduced grape must). Cooking meat in wine was a favored technique in high-status Roman cuisine, and this would have been a dish worthy of serving at an elite banquet.

### Ingredients
- 1 kg {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} shoulder roast
- 300 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 50 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="leek" %}
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="dill" %}
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F / 180°C.
2. Heat a little olive oil in a large dutch oven, and brown the pork shoulder on all sides.
3. Clean the leek and make sure to remove any dirt between the leaves. Add to the dutch oven along with wine, fish sauce, *defrutum*, and dill. Place the lid on the dutch oven, then place in the oven and cook for 1.5 hours or until the meat is cooked through.
4. Remove the meat from the dutch oven, dry it, and place on a dish. Sprinkle it with pepper and serve.
