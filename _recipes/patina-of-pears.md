# Patina of Pears

### Original Text
*patina de piris: pira elixa et purgata e medio; teres cum pipere cumino melle passo liquamine oleo modico. ouis missis patinam facies; piper super aspargis et inferes.*

### English Translation
Patina of pears: Boil the pears and remove the cores. Grind them with pepper, cumin, honey, *passum* [raisin wine], fish sauce, and a little oil. Add eggs and make a patina [baked dish]. Sprinkle pepper on top and serve.

—*Apicius*, 4.2.35, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This unusual Roman dessert showcases the Roman love of combining sweet and savory flavors in unexpected ways. The addition of fish sauce (*liquamen*) and cumin to what would otherwise be a sweet pear custard might seem strange to modern palates, but was typical of ancient Roman cuisine, which didn't make the same sharp distinctions between sweet and savory dishes that we do today. The *patina* was a versatile baked dish, similar to a modern frittata or custard, that could be made with virtually any ingredients.

### Ingredients
- 700g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pears" %}
- 200ml *passum* (raisin wine, substitute with sweet dessert wine)
- 60g {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- 1 Tb olive oil
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 4 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}
- ½ tsp ground black {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}, plus extra for serving

### Method
1. Peel and core the pears, then boil for 5 minutes. Place in a blender and blend until smooth. Alternatively, use 600g of canned pears (drained) and blend those instead.
2. Combine the pears with the remaining ingredients, and whisk together until smooth.
3. Pour the mixture into a greased casserole dish, and place in a pre-heated oven at 375°F/190°C. Bake for 35 minutes, or until it sets.
4. Serve with a sprinkling of freshly ground black pepper.

### Notes
The combination of sweet pears with savory elements like fish sauce and cumin is characteristic of Roman cuisine. While it may seem unusual to modern tastes, the fish sauce adds a salty depth that enhances rather than overwhelms the fruit, similar to how salt is used in modern desserts to enhance sweetness.
