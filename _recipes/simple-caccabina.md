# Simple *Caccabina*

### Original Text
*I. cacabina minore: olera diuersa elixa compone et pullina inter se, si uolueris; condis liquamine et oleo et bulliat. teres piper modicum et folium et cum tritura conmisces ouum et tribulas.*

### English Translation
I. Small *caccabina*: Arrange various boiled vegetables and chicken pieces together, if you wish; season with fish sauce and oil and let it boil. Grind a little pepper and *folium* and mix an egg with the ground mixture and stir in.

—*Vinidarius*, 1, c. 500

___

**Claude's intro:** The *cacabina minore* (small pot dish) is one of the simplest recipes in Vinidarius' collection, reflecting everyday cooking rather than elaborate banquet preparations. Named after the *caccabus* (cooking pot), this versatile one-pot meal combines vegetables with optional poultry, creating a nutritious, economical dish that would have been accessible to ordinary households. The addition of *folium* (likely cinnamon leaf) and the egg binding technique demonstrate the continued influence of earlier Roman culinary traditions, while the straightforward preparation method reflects the more practical approach to cooking in the late 5th century as the Western Roman Empire transitioned to Gothic rule. This dish represents how Roman culinary techniques survived in simplified forms during this period of cultural change.

### Ingredients
- 300g cabbage
- 300g boneless, skinless, {% include ingredient_link.html name="chicken" %} thigh
- 30ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 15ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 1 leaf of tejpat
- 3 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}

### Method
1. Chop the cabbage into thin strips. Place in a saucepan with water and boil for a few minutes, until cooked, then drain the water.
2. Chop the chicken into small pieces. Place in a separate saucepan or frying pan along with water and boil for a few minutes, or until cooked through, then drain the water.
3. In a large frying pan, place half the cabbage flat, then layer on the chicken, and finally layer on the rest of the cabbage. Pour over the fish sauce and olive oil. Heat the frying pan and boil for a few minutes.
4. Meanwhile, crush tejpant and grind with the pepper in a mortar and pestle. Add to a mixing bowl along with the eggs and whisk together.
5. Pour the beaten eggs over the *caccabina*, and continue to cook at medium heat until the mixture is set.
