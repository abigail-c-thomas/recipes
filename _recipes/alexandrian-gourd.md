This recipe, called "Alexandrian Gourd," reflects the cosmopolitan culinary influences of ancient Alexandria in Egypt, a major Mediterranean trading hub. The use of dates and honey creates a sweet-savory balance popular in North African cuisine, while the spice mixture adds depth and aroma.

### Ingredients
- 1 kg {% include ingredient_link.html name="squash" %} (or gourd, if you can find it)  
- 8 {% include ingredient_link.html name="date" %}s  
- 60 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pine nuts" %}  
- 4 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}

- 60 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}

### Method
1. Cut the squash into large pieces then boil until *al dente*. Remove from the water and place in a baking dish.

2. Place the dates in a bowl along with a little water, and microwave for a minute. Place in a food processor along with the pine nuts, and blend into a coarse paste.

3. Add the remaining ingredients to the food processor, and blend together.

4. Pour the sauce over the squash, then cover with a lid or foil. Place in a preheated oven at 180 C / 350 F for 15 minutes, or until reheated. Season with pepper and serve.
