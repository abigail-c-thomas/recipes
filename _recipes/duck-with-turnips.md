# Duck with Turnips

### Original Latin
*Gruem uel anatem ex rapis: lauas, ornas et in olla elixabis cum aqua sale et aneto dimidia coctura. rapas quoque, ut exbromari possint, leuabis de olla et iterum lauabis, et in caccabum mittis anatem cum oleo et liquamine et fasciculo porri et coriandri. rapam lotam et minutatim concisam desuper mittis, facies ut quoquatur. modica coctura mittis defritum ut coloret. ius tale parabis: piper cuminum coriandrum laseris radicem; suffundes acetum et ius de suo sibi; reexinanies super anatem ut ferueat. cum ferbuerit, amulo obligabis et super rapas adicies. piper aspargis et adponis.*

### English Translation
Crane or duck with turnips: You wash, prepare, and boil it in a pot with water, salt, and dill halfway. The turnips also, in order to remove the strong flavor, you take out of the pot and wash again, and put the duck in a saucepan with oil, fish sauce, and a bundle of leek and coriander. You put the washed and finely chopped turnip on top, and cook. When almost cooked, add *defrutum* to color. Prepare a sauce like this: pepper, cumin, coriander, *laser* root; pour on vinegar and its own juice; pour it back over the duck to heat. When it boils, thicken with starch and pour over the turnips. Sprinkle with pepper and serve.

—*Apicius*, 6.2.3, c. 4th century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** This luxurious dish combines tender duck with turnips in a richly spiced sauce. The recipe demonstrates the Roman technique of parboiling ingredients separately before combining them, and showcases their love of complex, layered flavors. Turnips were a common vegetable in Roman cuisine, and this preparation elevates them with aromatic herbs and a savory sauce thickened with starch.

### Ingredients
- 1 whole {% include ingredient_link.html name="duck" %} (about 2 kg)
- 600 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="turnips" %}, peeled and diced
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="salt" %}
- 2 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="dill" %}
- 3 tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 3 tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="leek" %}, halved and washed
- 1 small bunch {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %}
- 2 tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}
- 1/2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}, ground
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}, ground
- 3 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander seed" %}, ground
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- 2 tbsp red wine {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 1½ Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="cornstarch" %} mixed with water into a slurry

### Method
1. Remove the wings and neck from the duck and trim any excess skin and fat. Place the duck in a large dutch oven along with the trimmings and giblets (if included). Add the salt and dill along with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 45 minutes, until the duck is half-cooked.
2. Place the diced turnips in a separate pot. Bring to a boil, then immediately remove from the heat, pour out the hot water, and shock with cold water.
3. Remove the duck from the pot and reserve the stock for later. Clean out the dutch oven and then place the duck back inside.
4. Add the olive oil, fish sauce, leek, and coriander to the dutch oven, then add the cooked turnips on top. Cover and simmer on low heat for about 45 minutes, or until everything is cooked. Drizzle the *defrutum* over the duck mid-way through the cooking.
5. While the duck is cooking, combine the ground pepper, cumin, coriander seed, and asafoetida with the vinegar. Add 400 ml of the reserved stock, first skimming off the fat.
6. Once the duck is cooked, remove and discard the leek and coriander. Pour over the sauce, then bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust the sauce as needed, then add the cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce.
7. Remove the duck, turnips, and sauce to a serving platter. Carve the duck and serve with the turnip and sauce.

### Notes
- The original recipe mentions both crane and duck, but crane is no longer commonly eaten and duck makes an excellent substitute.
- Blanching the turnips separately removes their bitter flavor, a technique explicitly mentioned in the original recipe.
- This recipe showcases the Roman approach to layered cooking - first boiling, then simmering with herbs, and finally finishing with a spiced sauce.
- The *laser* mentioned in the original text refers to asafoetida, which was a common Roman substitute for the extinct silphium plant.
