# Chicken Tractogalatus

### Original Text
*Pullus Tractogalatus: pullum quoques liquamine oleo uino, cui mittis fasciculum coriandri, cepam. deinde cum coctus fuerit leuabis eum de iure suo et mittis in caccabum nouum lac et salem modicum, mel et aquae minimum, id est tertiam partem. ponis ad ignem lentum ut tepescat; tractum confringis et mittis paulatim; assidue agitas ne uratur. pullum illic mittis integrum uel carptum, uersabis in lance, quem perfundis ius tale: piper ligusticum origanum; suffundis mel et defritum modicum et ius de suo sibi. temperas. in caccabulo facies ut bulliat. cum bullierit, amulo obligas et inferes.*

Chicken with milk and flour: Cook the chicken in fish sauce, oil, and wine, with a bundle of coriander and an onion. When it is cooked, remove it from its broth and put in a new pot milk, a little salt, honey, and a small amount of water, about a third part. Place over a low fire until it warms. Break up the pasta (tracta) and add it little by little, stirring constantly so it doesn't burn. Put the chicken in there whole or pulled apart, turn it onto a plate, and pour this sauce over it: pepper, lovage, oregano; pour in honey, a little defrutum, and its own broth. Mix well. Heat it in a small pot until it boils. When it boils, thicken with starch and serve.

—*Apicius*, 6.8.13, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This unusual chicken dish combines the rich flavors of a milk and semolina porridge with a flavorful sauce. The name "tractogalatus" refers to the combination of "tracta" (a type of Roman flat dough or pasta) and milk (in Latin, "lac" or "galatum"). The dish showcases the Roman love of contrasting flavors and textures in a single recipe.

### Ingredients
- 4 chicken thighs, with skin and bone
- 300 ml white wine
- 60 ml fish sauce
- 1 onion, peeled and slice in half
- 1 small handful of coriander leaves
- 2 Tb olive olive
- 400 ml of milk
- 4 heaped Tb semolina
- 2 Tb + 2 Tb honey
- Pepper
- ½ tsp dried lovage
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 2 Tb *defrutum*
- 2 Tb cornstarch, mixed with water into a slurry

### Method
1. Add the white wine, fish sauce, onion, coriander leaves, and olive oil to a large saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the chicken thighs and simmer for about 25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
2. Add the milk, semolina, and 2 Tb honey to a separate saucepan, along with a couple pinches of salt. Heat and stir until it becomes very thick, being careful not to let it burn.
3. Once the chicken is cooked, remove from the cooking liquor. Cover in the semolina mixture and place onto a serving dish. Add the rest of the semolina around the chicken.
4. Prepare the sauce by adding the lovage, oregano, generous ground pepper, *defrutum*, final 2 Tb honey, and 200 ml of the chicken cooking liquor to another saucepan. Bring to a boil, then add the cornstarch slurry to thicken.
5. Pour the thickened sauce over the chicken and semolina, then serve.

### Notes
*Tractogalatus* means milk with *tracta*, an uncooked dough often used to thicken Roman sauces. I have used semolina as a substitute.

The final presentation of this dish is a little unclear to me. It seems that the milk/semolina mixture is supposed to adhere to the chicken in one solid mass. Perhaps the chicken and semolina mixture could be put into an oven at a low temperature for a few minutes while the sauce cooks?

Alternatively, for modern sensibilities it might be better to serve the chicken on the semolina with the sauce on the side.
