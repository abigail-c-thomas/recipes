# Chicken Tractogalatus

### Original Text
*Pullus Tractogalatus: pullum quoques liquamine oleo uino, cui mittis fasciculum coriandri, cepam. deinde cum coctus fuerit leuabis eum de iure suo et mittis in caccabum nouum lac et salem modicum, mel et aquae minimum, id est tertiam partem. ponis ad ignem lentum ut tepescat; tractum confringis et mittis paulatim; assidue agitas ne uratur. pullum illic mittis integrum uel carptum, uersabis in lance, quem perfundis ius tale: piper ligusticum origanum; suffundis mel et defritum modicum et ius de suo sibi. temperas. in caccabulo facies ut bulliat. cum bullierit, amulo obligas et inferes.*

### English Translation
Chicken with milk and flour: Cook the chicken in fish sauce, oil, and wine, with a bundle of coriander and an onion. When it is cooked, remove it from its broth and put in a new pot milk, a little salt, honey, and a small amount of water, about a third part. Place over a low fire until it warms. Break up the *tracta* and add it little by little, stirring constantly so it doesn't burn. Put the chicken in there whole or pulled apart, turn it onto a plate, and pour this sauce over it: pepper, lovage, oregano; pour in honey, a little *defrutum*, and its own broth. Mix well. Heat it in a small pot until it boils. When it boils, thicken with starch and serve.

—*Apicius*, 6.8.13, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This fascinating recipe showcases the sophisticated approach to textures in Roman cuisine. The name "tractogalatus" combines "*tracta*" (a type of Roman dough used for thickening) with milk ("galatum" from "lac"), creating a uniquely Roman dish with multiple components. The recipe demonstrates how Romans built dishes in stages - first poaching the chicken in aromatics, then creating a hearty porridge base, and finally finishing with a complex sauce. This layered approach to cooking, with each component bringing different flavors and textures, shows remarkable culinary sophistication for its time. The contrast between the creamy semolina base, tender chicken, and rich sauce would have created an impressive dish for Roman diners.

### Ingredients
- 4 {% include ingredient_link.html name="chicken" %} thighs, with skin and bone
- 300 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="white wine" %}
- 60 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="onion" %}, peeled and sliced in half
- 1 small handful of {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} leaves
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 400 ml of {% include ingredient_link.html name="milk" %}
- 4 heaped Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="semolina" %}
- 2 Tb + 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="oregano" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="cornstarch" %}, mixed with water into a slurry

### Method
1. Add the white wine, fish sauce, onion, coriander leaves, and olive oil to a large saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the chicken thighs and simmer for about 25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
2. Add the milk, semolina, and 2 Tb honey to a separate saucepan, along with a couple pinches of salt. Heat and stir until it becomes very thick, being careful not to let it burn.
3. Once the chicken is cooked, remove from the cooking liquor. Cover in the semolina mixture and place onto a serving dish. Add the rest of the semolina around the chicken.
4. Prepare the sauce by adding the lovage, oregano, generous ground pepper, *defrutum*, final 2 Tb honey, and 200 ml of the chicken cooking liquor to another saucepan. Bring to a boil, then add the cornstarch slurry to thicken.
5. Pour the thickened sauce over the chicken and semolina, then serve.

### Notes
- *Tractogalatus* means milk with *tracta*, a type of dough used in Roman cooking, particularly for thickening dishes. Semolina makes an excellent modern substitute.
- *Tracta* was likely a thin sheet of wheat dough that was dried and then crumbled into dishes as a thickener - not pasta or pastry as we know them today.
- For better presentation, you could place the chicken and semolina mixture in a 150°C/300°F oven for 5-10 minutes to set slightly while preparing the sauce.
- This dish demonstrates the Roman technique of "multiple cookings" - where ingredients are cooked separately then combined.
- For modern tastes, you might prefer to serve the chicken on a bed of the semolina porridge with the sauce drizzled over top.
