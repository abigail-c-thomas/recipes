___

**Claude's intro:** This third variation of *oxyporium* features mint and lovage, giving it a fresher and more herbaceous profile than other versions. Like other *oxyporium* recipes, it was used both as a digestive aid and a condiment, particularly for foods the Romans considered difficult to digest. Columella's inclusion of both this and the previous *oxyporium* recipe in his agricultural treatise indicates the importance of such medicinal-culinary preparations in Roman households. The addition of raisins provides a subtle sweetness that balances the sharpness of the vinegar and aromatic herbs.

### Ingredients
- ½ tsp white {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}
- ½ tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="mint" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="raisin" %}, finely chopped
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 Tb red wine {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}

### Method
1. Mix all the ingredients together thoroughly.
2. Serve with lettuce as a salad dressing, or consume alongside lettuce by the teaspoon.

### Notes
- This mint-flavored version would have offered Romans a different flavor profile for their digestive sauce, perhaps preferred by some for its fresher taste compared to the more heavily spiced versions.
- Lovage (ligusticum) was a very common herb in Roman cuisine, mentioned in numerous recipes from Apicius. It has a flavor somewhat similar to celery but more complex.
- Raisins add a natural sweetness that complements the honey and balances the acidity of the vinegar.
- Roman recipes often included multiple variations of similar dishes, suggesting that trying different flavor combinations was important to their culinary culture.
