"Julian pottage: Pour clean spelt [grain], cook it, add oil. When it boils, thicken it. Add cooked brains, bring to a boil. When it has boiled, remove it in slices. Cut the meat as if for forcemeat, with laser, pepper, and fish sauce. Cook in a pottage pot placed on coals, and season. Make other Julian pottage thus: pour clean spelt, cook it, add fish sauce and raisin wine or honeyed wine, grind pepper, lovage, fennel seed, moisten with liquid, pour back into the pot over the pottage. Stroke the top."

â€”*Apicius*, *De Re Coquinaria* 5.1.1/4, 4th-5th century CE

This hearty grain dish is attributed to either the Julian family or possibly to Julius Caesar himself. It combines a semolina porridge base with seasoned ground meat, creating a substantial meal that would have been filling and nutritious.
