**Claude's intro:** Kandaulos (or candaulos) was a rich Lydian dish that became well-known throughout the ancient Greek world. This simple version uses bread and cheese to create a thick, savory stew that's filling and flavorful. The recipe is mentioned by Athenaeus, who attributes it to Hegesippus of Tarentum, and describes it as a Lydian delicacy that combines meat with cheese and bread in a distinctive way.

### Ingredients
- 800 g diced beef (or lamb or pork)
- 750 ml beef stock
- 200 g bread, with the crust
- 200 g Feta cheese
- 2 tsp dried dill leaf
- 1 Tb olive oil

### Method
1. Heat up the olive oil in a dutch oven. Add the diced beef and fry until browned.
2. Add the beef stock. Bring to a simmer, and cook for an hour.
3. Break the bread into small pieces and add to the dutch oven, then crumble the Feta cheese into the dutch oven. Add the dill, stir to combine
4. Simmer for a further 15 minutes, adding water if needed, then serve.
