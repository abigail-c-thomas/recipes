# Whitebait Patina

**Claude's intro:** This Roman fish omelette, or patina, uses small whitebait fish cooked with eggs to create a simple but flavorful dish. The combination of fish sauce and wine creates a savory base that enhances the delicate fish flavor.

### Ingredients
- 300g whitebait or other small fish
- 4 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}
- 2 tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 60ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}
- 2 tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %} to taste

### Method
1. Whisk the eggs, then mix together with the fish.
2. Add the oil, wine, and fish sauce to a frying pan and bring to a simmer. Pour the egg and fish into the pan and cook.
3. Once the underside has nicely browned, flip the omelette. Cook until the other side is also browned and the omelette is cooked through. Turn onto a plate, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

### Notes
- Recipe 4.2.20 and 4.2.26 are very similar, though 4.2.26 calls for *lagita* fish to be used. This fish might refer to the horse-mackerel, but the identification is unclear.
- The recipe calls for a simple *oenogarum* to be poured on top of the omelette. I am not sure if this refers to the olive oil/wine/fish sauce mixture that the omelette is cooked in, or an additional *oenogarum* prepared separately. Here I have chosen the former interpretation.
