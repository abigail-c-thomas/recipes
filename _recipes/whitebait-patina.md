# Whitebait Patina

### Original Latin
**patina de apua fricata**: apua lauas oua confringes et cum apua commisces. adicies liquamen uinum oleum, facies ut ferueat, et cum ferbuerit, mittes apuam. cum duxerit subtiliter uersas. facies ut coloet, oenogarum simplex perfundes, piper asparges et inferes.

### English Translation
**Patina of fried whitebait**: Wash the whitebait, break eggs and mix with the whitebait. Add fish sauce, wine, and oil, bring to a boil, and when it boils, add the whitebait. When it has thickened, turn it gently. Allow it to drain, pour over simple wine-fish sauce, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

â€”*Apicius*, 4.2.20, c. 350

Claude's intro: Fish patinas were a common dish in Roman cuisine, often combining eggs with fish to create something similar to a modern frittata or omelette. Whitebait (apua) was a popular small fish in Mediterranean cooking, though any small fish could be used. The Romans particularly enjoyed these protein-rich dishes finished with flavorful sauces like oenogarum, a mixture of wine and fish sauce.

### Ingredients
- 250g small fry (or any white fish fillet, broken into chunks)
- 4 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}
- 30ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 30ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}
- 20ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Whisk the eggs, then mix together with the fish.
2. Add the oil, wine, and fish sauce to a frying pan and bring to a simmer. Pour the egg and fish into the pan and cook.
3. Once the underside has nicely browned, flip the omelette. Cook until the other side is also browned and the omelette is cooked through. Turn onto a plate, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

### Notes
- Recipe 4.2.20 and 4.2.26 are very similar, though 4.2.26 calls for *lagita* fish to be used. This fish might refer to the horse-mackerel, but the identification is unclear.
- The recipe calls for a simple *oenogarum* to be poured on top of the omelette. I am not sure if this refers to the olive oil/wine/fish sauce mixture that the omelette is cooked in, or an additional *oenogarum* prepared separately. Here I have chosen the former interpretation.
