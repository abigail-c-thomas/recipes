# Rock Melon

### Original Text
> Pepones et melones: piper puleium mel vel passum liquamen acetum. interdum et silfi accedit.

"Melons and rock melons: pepper, pennyroyal, honey or raisin wine, fish sauce, vinegar. Sometimes silphium is also added."

â€”*Apicius*, 3.7, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This unusual fruit preparation demonstrates the Roman tendency to combine sweet, sour, and savory flavors in unexpected ways. While modern palates typically encounter melon in purely sweet preparations, the Romans enjoyed it with savory condiments including the distinctly umami fish sauce (garum). The addition of honey, vinegar, and aromatic herbs creates a complex flavor profile that highlights the versatility of melons in Roman cuisine. This recipe, like many in Apicius, shows how Romans approached fruit as ingredients that could cross between sweet and savory preparations, rather than limiting them to desserts as modern cuisine often does.

### Ingredients
- Half a {% include ingredient_link.html name="melon" %}  
- 2 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="mint" %} or {% include ingredient_link.html name="pennyroyal" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- Black {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}

### Method
1. Peel the rock melon, then dice into bite sized pieces. Arrange on a serving dish.

2. Mix together the remaining ingredients in a small bowl. Pour over the rock melon, toss, and leave to chill for 15 minutes, then serve sprinkled with pepper.

### Notes
The text for both 3.6.3 (cucumber salad) and 3.7 in Apicius are identical except for the title.
