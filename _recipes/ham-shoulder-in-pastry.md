# Ham Shoulder in Pastry

### Original Text
*Pernam, ubi eam cum caricis plurimis elixaueris et tribus lauri foliis, detracta cute tessellatim incidis et melle conplebis. deinde farinam oleo subactam contexes et ei coreum reddis ut, cum farina cocta fuerit, eximas furno et ut est inferes.*

### English Translation
Ham shoulder: when you have boiled it with plenty of figs and three bay leaves, remove the skin, cut it into small squares, and fill it with honey. Then cover it with dough kneaded with oil and wrap it in the skin so that when the dough is cooked, you can take it from the oven and serve as it is.

—*Apicius*, 7.9.1, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This elaborate preparation of ham wrapped in pastry exemplifies the sophisticated cooking techniques of the Roman elite. While meat was common in Roman cuisine, this particular method of preparing ham represents a more luxurious approach. The combination of honey-filled ham with a simple oil pastry creates a spectacular presentation piece that would have impressed guests at a Roman banquet. This dish was reportedly part of the *tetrapharmakum* (four-drug), a famous gourmet dish allegedly invented by the emperor Aelius Verus and enjoyed by both Hadrian and Alexander Severus, according to the often-unreliable *Historia Augusta*. The modern concept of meat en croûte or Wellington-style dishes may trace their lineage back to Roman preparations like this one.

### Ingredients
- 1.5 kg ham shoulder
- 10 dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="figs" %}
- 3 {% include ingredient_link.html name="bay leaves" %}
- 200 g white {% include ingredient_link.html name="flour" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- ¼ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="salt" %}
- 100 ml water
- 100 g set {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}

### Method
1. Boil the ham shoulder with the figs and the bay leaves for about 1.5 hours, or until cooked. Remove the ham shoulder from the water and allow it to cool.
2. Prepare the pastry by mixing together the flour, salt, and oil, then combining with water to form a dough. Knead until smooth and pliable.
3. Remove the skin of the ham (if present) and score meat in a grid fashion. Pour on the honey. Next roll out the pastry into a thin sheet with a rolling pin. Place the ham in the center and wrap so that it is entirely enclosed, sealing the edges.
4. Place the ham in a preheated oven at 190°C/375°F and bake for 50 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp. Remove from the oven and serve.

### Notes
- The honey tends to leak out during baking. To prevent this, you might increase the olive oil in the pastry to make a more pliable, less porous crust.
- The liquor the ham is cooked in can be used to boil barley, which makes an excellent accompaniment to the meal.
- Modern versions of this recipe exist, such as ham en croute, suggesting the enduring appeal of this preparation method.
