**Claude's intro:** This recipe reflects the Roman practice of combining meat with legumes, creating a nutritionally complete and satisfying dish. Cowpeas, while less common in modern European cooking, were an important legume in ancient Mediterranean cuisines. The combination of lamb with cowpeas would have created a hearty meal, with the fish sauce (garum) and asafoetida (a replacement for the extinct silphium/laser) providing the distinctive savory flavor profile characteristic of Roman cooking. The dish is relatively simple, demonstrating that not all Roman cuisine was elaborate or complex.

### Ingredients
- 800 g diced {% include ingredient_link.html name="lamb" %}
- 400 g dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="cowpeas" %}
- 60 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- Generous ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Soak the cowpeas in cool water for 8 hours.
2. Brown the diced lamb in a dutch oven.
3. Drain the cowpeas and add to the dutch oven along with the remaining ingredients. Add enough water to cover everything. Bring to a simmer and cook, with the lid on, for 50 minutes or until the cowpeas are becoming mushy.
