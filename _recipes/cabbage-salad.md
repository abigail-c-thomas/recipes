# Cabbage Salad

### Original Text
From Cato, *De Agricultura* 157:

> Brassicam macerato, postea aqua commutato; diu in aqua macerato; postea cum salis sextario, coriandri semine, cumini quantum voles, dragon, silfi, aceto macerato; post id oleum superstillato; 

"Macerate the cabbage, then change the water; macerate it for a long time in water; afterward macerate it with a sextarius of salt, coriander seed, as much cumin as you want, dragon herb, silphium, and vinegar; afterward drip oil over it;"

—Cato, *De Agricultura* 157, 2nd century BCE

Also quoted in Oribasius *Medical Collections* 4.4.1, citing Mnesitheus, 4th century BCE.

This ancient cabbage salad recipe appears in multiple sources across centuries, suggesting its popularity and effectiveness. Cato included it in his agricultural manual with claims about its medicinal properties, noting it could cure headaches and aid digestion. The recipe was also recorded by the physician Oribasius, who cited it from the even earlier Greek physician Mnesitheus.

### Ingredients
- 1 small {% include ingredient_link.html name="cabbage" %}  
- 2 tsp fresh {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}, finely chopped  
- 3 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} leaf, chopped  
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}  
- 3 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="red wine vinegar" %}  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="salt" %}

### Method
1. Finely slice the cabbage, and toss together with the herbs, salt, and asafoetida.

2. Mix together the honey and the vinegar. Pour over the salad, toss everything together, and serve.

### Notes
This recipe appears both in Oribasius's medical compilations from the 4th century CE, where he attributes it to Mnesitheus (who lived in the 4th century BCE), and in Cato's *De Agricultura* from the 2nd century BCE. Pliny's *Natural Historia* also mentions this preparation, using Cato as a source.

The recipe was considered medicinal - Pliny claims it can cure headaches and is good for upset stomachs. Modern science confirms that cabbage contains compounds that can soothe inflammation.

The original recipe calls for "dragon" herb (likely tarragon) and silphium (extinct, now substituted with asafoetida). It also suggests soaking and rinsing the cabbage multiple times, which would reduce its bitterness. Modern cabbage varieties are less bitter, so this step can be simplified.

The combination of honey and vinegar (called oxymel) was a common base for many Roman dressings and sauces, creating a sweet-and-sour flavor profile that is still enjoyed in Mediterranean cuisine today.
