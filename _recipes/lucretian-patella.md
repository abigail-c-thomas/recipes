**Claude's intro:** The Lucretian Patella is an intriguing seafood dish from Apicius, featuring salted fish prepared with a sweet-savory sauce. The dish is named either after Lucretius, the famous Roman poet and philosopher, or more likely after a now-unknown cook or gastronome named Lucretius who might have invented or popularized this preparation. This recipe showcases the Roman appreciation for salted fish, which was a valuable commodity in the ancient world as it provided a reliable source of protein that could be stored for extended periods without refrigeration. The combination of onions, honey, and vinegar creates a balanced sauce that would have complemented the intense saltiness of the preserved fish.

### Ingredients
- 320 g salted fish
- 1 large white {% include ingredient_link.html name="onion" %}, finely diced
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="savoury" %}

### Method
1. Rinse the salt from the fish. Place in a large bowl, cover with water, and leave to soak in the fridge for at least a few hours, changing the water several times.
2. When ready to cook, place the onions in a frying pan along with the fish sauce, olive oil, and 2 Tb of water. Cook for about 5 minutes or until the onions are translucent.
3. Drain the salted fish and place in the frying pan, and cook until the fish is almost done.
4. Add the remaining ingredients to the frying pan. Mix everything together for a few minutes, then taste and adjust seasonings if needed. Remove from the heat and serve.

### Notes
- The original recipe calls for sphondyli (a type of shellfish) and pine nuts, which have been adapted in this modern version.
- Salted fish needs thorough soaking before cooking to remove excess salt. The soaking time will depend on the thickness and salt content of your fish.
- Apicius 4.2.24 provides a similar recipe for salt fish.
- Modern salt cod or other salted fish can be used in this recipe.
