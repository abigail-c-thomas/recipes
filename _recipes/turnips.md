# Turnips

### Original Text
> Rapas sive napos elixatos exprimis. deinde teres cuminum plurimum rutam minus laser Particum mel acetum liquamen defritum et oleum modice; fervere facies et inferes.

"Boiled turnips or navews: drain them. Then grind a good amount of cumin, less rue, Parthian laser, honey, vinegar, fish sauce, reduced wine, and a little oil; bring to a boil and serve."

—*Apicius*, *De Re Coquinaria* 3.13.1, 4th-5th century CE

This recipe transforms humble turnips with a complex, aromatic sauce. The combination of sweet, sour, and savory elements was typical of Roman cuisine, as was the use of cumin and rue with root vegetables.

### Ingredients
- 600g {% include ingredient_link.html name="turnip" %}s  
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}  
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}  
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method
1. Peel and cut the turnips into large wedges. Bring water to the boil in a large saucepan, then add the turnips. Boil for 20 minutes, or until fork tender.

2. Drain the turnips, and place them back in the saucepan. Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a simmer, then serve.

### Notes
On reflection I think these should be mashed, see Vinidarius 7 for similar but more detailed instructions.
