# Turnips

### Original Text
> Rapas sive napos elixatos exprimis. deinde teres cuminum plurimum rutam minus laser Particum mel acetum liquamen defritum et oleum modice; fervere facies et inferes.

"Boiled turnips or navews: drain them. Then grind a good amount of cumin, less rue, Parthian laser, honey, vinegar, fish sauce, reduced wine, and a little oil; bring to a boil and serve."

—*Apicius*, 3.13.1, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This recipe transforms humble turnips with a complex, aromatic sauce—a perfect example of how Romans elevated simple vegetables through sophisticated seasonings. The combination of sweet (honey, defrutum), sour (vinegar), and savory elements (fish sauce) was typical of Roman cuisine, as was the use of cumin and rue with root vegetables. The inclusion of asafoetida (laser Parthicum), an expensive imported resin with a pungent flavor, suggests this dish was intended for a wealthy household rather than peasant fare. Roman agricultural writers like Pliny and Columella discussed turnip cultivation extensively, indicating its importance in the Roman diet across social classes.

### Ingredients
- 600g {% include ingredient_link.html name="turnip" %}s  
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}  
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}  
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}  
- 2 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method
1. Peel and cut the turnips into large wedges. Bring water to the boil in a large saucepan, then add the turnips. Boil for 20 minutes, or until fork tender.

2. Drain the turnips, and place them back in the saucepan. Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a simmer, then serve.

### Notes
On reflection I think these should be mashed, see Vinidarius 7 for similar but more detailed instructions.
