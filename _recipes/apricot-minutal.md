# Apricot Minutal

### Original Text
**minutal ex praecoquiis**: adicies in caccabo oleum liquamen uinum; concides cepam ascaloniam aridam; spatulam porcinam coctam tessellatim concides. his omnibus coctis teres piper cuminum mentam siccam anetum; suffundis mel liquamen passum acetum modice ius de suo sibi; temperabis; praecoqua enucleata mittis, facies ut ferueant donec percoquantur. tractam confringes, et ea obligas, piper aspargis et inferes.

**Minutal with apricots**: Put in a pot oil, fish sauce and wine; cut up a dry shallot; cut a cooked shoulder of pork into small pieces. When all these are cooked, grind pepper, cumin, dried mint, and dill; moisten with honey, fish sauce, *passum*, a little vinegar, and the cooking juices; mix together; add the apricots with stones removed, bring to a boil until fully cooked. Break up a piece of pastry and use it to thicken the sauce, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

â€”*Apicius*, 4.3.6, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** In Roman cuisine, fruit was often included in savory meat dishes. This combination of sweet and savory flavors was a hallmark of sophisticated Roman cookery. This minutal (a type of stew or hash) combines pork shoulder with apricots and aromatic spices to create a balanced dish showing the Roman fondness for mixing fruit with meat.

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 200 C/400 F. Lightly coat the pork in olive oil, place in a roasting tin, and roast for about 45 minutes, or until the exterior is browned. Remove the pork from the oven and allow to cool.
2. Finely dice the onions, and dice the pork into bite-sized pieces, and then add both to a large pot along with the wine, fish sauce, and olive oil. Bring to a simmer, then put a lid on and cook for 20 minutes.
3. Add the herbs, spices, *passum*, honey, vinegar, and apricots to the pot. Simmer for another 20 minutes.
4. Add the cornstarch slurry, and allow to thicken. Taste, adjust seasonings as desired, and serve with freshly ground pepper sprinkled on top.
