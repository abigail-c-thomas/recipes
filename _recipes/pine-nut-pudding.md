### Original Text
*aliter dulcia: piper nucleos mel rutam et passum teres; cum lacte et tractam coques. coagulum coque cum modicis ouis. perfusum melle, pipere aspersum inferes.*

Another sweet dish: Grind together pepper, pine nuts, honey, rue and *passum* [sweet wine]. Cook with milk and *tracta* [pastry]. Cook rennet with a few eggs. Pour honey over, sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

â€”*Apicius*, 7.11.5, c. 4th century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** This Roman custard represents the sophisticated side of ancient desserts, combining the luxury ingredient of pine nuts with aromatic flavors. The original recipe includes *tracta* (a type of pastry) and rennet, which would have created a texture similar to a modern cheesecake. This adaptation simplifies the preparation while maintaining the characteristic Roman combination of sweet and spicy flavors. Pine nuts were highly prized in Roman cuisine and often featured in elaborate dishes served at wealthy households.

### Ingredients
- 600 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="milk" %}
- 60 ml *passum* (raisin wine, substituted with sweet dessert wine)
- 60 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %} + more for serving
- 80 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="pine nuts" %}, lightly crushed
- 2 tsp fresh {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %} (substitute with rosemary if unavailable)
- 3 Tb cornstarch
- 4 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 350 F / 180 C.
2. Add the milk, *passum*, honey, pine nuts, rue, and cornstarch to a saucepan along with a generous amount of ground pepper, and whisk together.
3. Place the saucepan on the stove and gently heat while stirring, until the mixture thickens to the consistency of custard. Take off the heat and allow it to cool for a few minutes.
4. Whisk the eggs thoroughly, then pour into the milk mixture. Then pour everything into a dish and bake in the oven for about 45 minutes, or until the custard is set.
5. Remove from the oven, generously sprinkle with pepper and pour honey over. Chill in the fridge before serving.

### Notes
The original recipe calls for *tracta* (a type of Roman pastry) and coagulum (rennet), which would have given this dish a different texture. This adaptation maintains the flavor profile while using modern ingredients and techniques. Be cautious with fresh rue, as it is a potent herb - if unavailable, substitute with rosemary or omit entirely.
