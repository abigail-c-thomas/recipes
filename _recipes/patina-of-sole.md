# Patina of Sole

### Original Text
*patina solearum: soleas battues et curatas conpones in patina; adicies oleum liquamen uinum; dum quoquitur teres piper ligusticum origanum; fricabis; suffundes ius, oua cruda, ut unum corpus facias; super soleas refundes, lento igni quoques. cum duxerit piper aspargis et inferes.*

### English Translation
Patina of sole: Beat the soles, clean them and arrange them in a dish. Add oil, fish sauce and wine. While it cooks, grind pepper, lovage and oregano; pound together. Pour over the juice, add raw eggs to make a uniform mixture, pour over the soles, and cook on a low heat. When it has thickened, sprinkle with pepper and serve.

—*Apicius*, 4.2.28, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This Roman dish combines sole fillets with a savory egg mixture flavored with herbs and wine. The "patina" is a type of baked dish similar to a frittata, where ingredients are bound together with eggs. This cooking technique was very popular in ancient Rome, especially for fish preparations, allowing the delicate flavors to shine while creating a substantial meal.

### Ingredients
- 300g {% include ingredient_link.html name="sole" %} fillets
- 20ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 15ml olive oil
- 45ml white wine
- 4 eggs
- Pinch of {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- Pinch of {% include ingredient_link.html name="oregano" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}

### Method
1. Place the sole fillets in a frying pan along with the fish sauce, olive oil, and white wine. Gently bring to heat and poach the sole fillets until they are cooked through, then remove from heat and allow to cool.
2. Whisk together the eggs, lovage, and oregano along with a generous grind of black pepper. Pour over the sole and gently mix so that the eggs and cooking liquor combine.
3. Place the frying pan back over the heat and cook gently until the egg mixture is set. If you like, once the egg mixture is mostly cooked you can place the frying pan under the broiler to set the top.

### Notes
As an alternative to cooking the patina over the stove, you can instead perform the last step in an oven. Transfer the cooked sole, cooking liquor, and egg mixture to an oven-proof dish, and then bake at 350F/180C for 20–25 minutes, until the egg mixture is just set.
