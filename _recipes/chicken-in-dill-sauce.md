# Chicken in Dill Sauce

### Original Latin
*Pullum elixo ius crudum: adicies in mortarium aneti semen mentam siccam laseris radicem; suffundis acetum; adicies careotam, refundis liquamen senapis modicum et oleum, defrito temperas et sic mittis.*

*Pullum anetatum: mellis modice, liquamine temperabis. levas pullum coctum et sabano mundo siccas; caraxas et ius scissuris infundis ut conuiuat. et cum coniuerit assabis et suo sibi iure pinnis tangis. piper aspersum inferes.*

### English Translation
Raw sauce for boiled chicken: Add to a mortar dill seed, dried mint, and *laser* root; pour in vinegar; add dates, pour in fish sauce, a little mustard and oil, mix with *defrutum* and serve it thus.

Chicken with dill: Mix a moderate amount of honey with fish sauce. Take the cooked chicken and dry it with a clean cloth. Score it and pour the sauce into the cuts so it absorbs the flavor. When it has absorbed the sauce, roast it and baste with its own sauce using feathers. Sprinkle with pepper and serve.

—*Apicius*, 6.8.1-2, c. 4th century CE

Claude's intro: This delicious chicken preparation demonstrates the Roman approach to layering flavors. The recipe combines two parts - first creating a complex sauce with herbs and sweeteners, then applying it to chicken using a two-stage cooking process. The technique of scoring the meat to allow it to absorb the sauce is particularly noteworthy, as it allows the flavors to penetrate deeply. While the original recipe suggests using feathers for basting, modern kitchen tools work just as well. The combination of sweet (honey, date syrup) and savory elements (fish sauce, herbs) creates a balanced dish that highlights the importance of dill in Roman cooking.

### Ingredients
- 4 {% include ingredient_link.html name="chicken" %} thighs
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="dill" %} seed
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="mustard" %} seed
- A pinch of {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- 2 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="mint" %}
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 2 Tb white wine {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="date syrup" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %} to serve

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F.
2. Grind the dill and mustard seeds, then mix all of the ingredients, except the chicken, together into a sauce.
3. Place the chicken thighs in a roasting tin. Pour the sauce over the chicken so that it is completely covered on all sides.
4. Place the chicken in the oven for about 45 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Baste the chicken with the sauce every 10 minutes or so. Once cooked, serve sprinkled with pepper.

### Notes
- This recipe simplifies the two-stage cooking process described in the original text, which called for first boiling the chicken, then marinating it in sauce, and finally roasting it.
- The Roman recipes often called for scoring the meat to allow flavors to penetrate better, a technique still used in many cuisines today.
- This interpretation is based on Sally Grainger's work in *Cooking Apicius*, a respected source for practical adaptations of ancient Roman recipes.
- The *laser* mentioned in the original recipe refers to asafoetida, a strong-smelling gum resin used as a substitute for the extinct silphium plant.
