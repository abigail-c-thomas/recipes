# Chicken in Dill Sauce

### Original Text
*Pullum elixo ius crudum: adicies in mortarium aneti semen mentam siccam laseris radicem; suffundis acetum; adicies careotam, refundis liquamen senapis modicum et oleum, defrito temperas et sic mittis.*

*Pullum anetatum: mellis modice, liquamine temperabis. levas pullum coctum et sabano mundo siccas; caraxas et ius scissuris infundis ut conuiuat. et cum coniuerit assabis et suo sibi iure pinnis tangis. piper aspersum inferes.*

Raw sauce for boiled chicken: Add to a mortar dill seed, dried mint, and laser root; pour in vinegar; add dates, pour in fish sauce, a little mustard and oil, mix with reduced grape must and serve it thus.

Chicken with dill: Mix a moderate amount of honey with fish sauce. Take the cooked chicken and dry it with a clean cloth. Score it and pour the sauce into the cuts so it absorbs the flavor. When it has absorbed the sauce, roast it and baste with its own sauce using feathers. Sprinkle with pepper and serve.

â€”*Apicius*, 6.8.1-2, c. 4th century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** A delicious way to prepare chicken with an aromatic sauce featuring dill as the dominant flavor. The combination of sweet (honey, date syrup) and savory elements (fish sauce, herbs) creates a complex and well-balanced dish.

### Ingredients
- 4 chicken thighs
- 1 tsp dill seed
- 1 tsp mustard seed
- A pinch of asafoetida
- 2 tsp dried mint
- 3 Tb fish sauce
- 2 Tb white wine vinegar
- 2 Tb date syrup
- 1 Tb honey
- 1 Tb *defrutum*
- 1 Tb olive oil
- Pepper to serve

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 190C.
2. Grind the dill and mustard seeds, then mix all of the ingredients, except the chicken, together into a sauce.
3. Place the chicken thighs in a roasting tin. Pour the sauce over the chicken so that it is completely covered on all sides.
4. Place the chicken in the oven for about 45 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Baste the chicken with the sauce every 10 minutes or so. Once cooked, serve sprinkled with pepper.

### Notes
This is, with minor adjustments, the recipe suggested on pg 67-8 of Sally Grainger's *Cooking Apicius*.
