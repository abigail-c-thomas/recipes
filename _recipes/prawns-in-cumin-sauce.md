### Ingredients
- 450 g uncooked {% include ingredient_link.html name="prawns" %}, peeled and deveined
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- A small handful {% include ingredient_link.html name="parsley" %}, finely chopped
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- 1 tejpat leaf (optional)

### Method
1. Boil the prawns in salted water until they turn pink and are cooked through, about 2-3 minutes.
2. While the prawns are cooking, combine the remaining ingredients in a small pan, crushing the tejpat leaf if using. Bring to a gentle simmer then take off the heat and remove the tejpat leaf.
3. Once the prawns are cooked, drain them, pour over the sauce, and serve.

### Notes
- The original recipe calls for lobster, but prawns make a more accessible modern substitute.
- *Malabathrum* mentioned in the original recipe was likely tejpat (Indian bay leaf), which was an expensive imported spice in Roman times.
- This sauce appears in multiple places in Apicius (1.29, 9.1.3, and 9.7), showing its versatility and popularity.
- The combination of cumin and honey creates a sweet-savory balance that complements shellfish perfectly.
