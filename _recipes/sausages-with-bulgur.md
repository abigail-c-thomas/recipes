# Sausages with Bulgur

### Original Latin
**aliter**: coctam alicam et tritam cum pulpa concisa et trita una cum piper et liquamine et nucleis. farcies intestinum et elixabis, deinde cum sale assabis et cum sinapi inferes, uel sic concisum in disco.

### English Translation
**Another way**: Cooked *alica* and crushed together with minced and ground meat along with pepper, fish sauce, and pine nuts. Stuff into intestine and boil, then roast with salt and serve with mustard, or cut up and [serve] on a dish.

â€”*Apicius*, 2.5.2, c. 350

Claude's intro: Sausage-making was a widespread practice in ancient Rome, with many varieties of sausages (*farcimina*, *botelli*, *lucanicae*) mentioned in Roman literature. Romans used a variety of fillings and techniques, creating both fresh sausages for immediate consumption and smoked or dried sausages for preservation. This recipe is notable for its inclusion of *alica* (a type of wheat similar to modern bulgur or spelt), which would have extended the meat and created a different texture compared to all-meat sausages. The combining of grains with meat was common in Roman cooking, both for economic reasons and for variety of texture and flavor. This sausage would have been a hearty, everyday food, appropriate for a quick meal.
