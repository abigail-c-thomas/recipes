**Lamb stew**: Put pieces of meat in a pot. Finely chop onion and coriander; grind pepper, lovage, and cumin; add fish sauce, oil, and wine. Cook, then pour into a serving dish; thicken with starch.

â€”*Apicius*, 8.6.2, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This simple lamb stew from Apicius represents a common approach to meat dishes in Roman cuisine. The combination of meat with aromatic herbs and spices (coriander, pepper, lovage, and cumin) creates a rich flavor profile characteristic of Roman cooking. The use of wine and fish sauce (garum) provides depth, while the final thickening with starch was a typical Roman technique to create proper consistency. This dish would have been served as part of a main meal, accompanied by bread or other side dishes. Roman stews like this one were practical ways to tenderize tougher cuts of meat while infusing them with flavor.
