# Columella's Oxyporium

### Original Text
From Columella's *De Re Rustica* (On Agriculture) 12.59e:

> Aliter oxyporum digestibile: piperis albi, si sit; sin minus, nigri unciae duae, petroselini unciae tres, laser parvum, quod Syriaci unius denarii pondus efficiat, casei veteris sapae unciae singulae. Haec bene trita miscentur, et in ollulam vitream conduntur: deinde melle despumato, quantum sufficiat, diluta consumuntur.

"Another digestible oxyporium: 2 ounces of white pepper, or if not available, black pepper, 3 ounces of parsley seed, a small amount of laser the weight of one Syrian denarius, 1 ounce each of aged cheese and reduced wine. These ingredients are well ground, mixed, and placed in a glass jar; then they are consumed diluted with sufficient skimmed honey."

—Columella, *De Re Rustica* 12.59e, 1st century CE

___

This is Columella's version of *oxyporium*, a spiced digestive aid. Unlike Apicius' recipe, this one includes aged cheese and parsley (or celery) seed, creating a richer flavor profile. Columella was a prominent Roman writer on agriculture who lived in the 1st century CE.

### Ingredients
- 1 tsp white {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}  
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="celery seed" %}  
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="laser" %} root (asafoetida)  
- 1 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="parmesan" %} cheese  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}

### Method
1. Mix all the ingredients together.

2. Serve with lettuce as a salad dressing, or consume alongside lettuce by the teaspoon.

### Notes
The original recipe calls for "petroselini" which could refer to parsley seed, though in this adaptation celery seed is used as a more readily available substitute. The Romans often used these flavors interchangeably.

Laser (silphium) was an expensive spice that became extinct in ancient times. Asafoetida is the closest modern substitute and provides a similar pungent, earthy flavor.

Aged cheese like Parmesan is used here to approximate the "casei veteris" (aged cheese) mentioned by Columella. The Romans prized aged cheeses for their strong flavors and believed they had digestive benefits.

This mixture would have been served alongside raw vegetables or taken medicinally to aid digestion, particularly after consuming foods that were considered difficult to digest.
