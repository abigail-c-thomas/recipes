<!-- TODO: Add description paragraph about the use of nettles and other wild greens in Roman cuisine -->

### Ingredients
- 250g nettles, spinach, or other leafy green
- 20ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 30ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 6 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Wash and coarsely chop the greens. Add to a frying pan along with the fish sauce, olive oil, and a generous quantity of ground pepper, and cook.
2. Once the leaves are wilted, remove from the heat. Drain any excess liquid if present, then return the leaves to the frying pan.
3. Beat the 6 eggs, then pour over the leaves. Return the frying pan to the heat and cook until the bottom is cooked. Then either flip the omelette, or alternatively place the frying pan under the broiler to allow the top to cook. Serve either hot or cold.
