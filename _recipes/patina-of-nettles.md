### Original Text
**patina urticarum calida et frigida**: urticam accipies, lauas, colas per colum, exsiccabis in tabula; eam concides. teres piperis scripulos X, suffundes liquamen, fricabis. postea adicies liquaminis ciatos duos, olei uncias VI. caccabus ferueat; cum ferbuerit coctam tolles ut refrigescat; postea patinam mundam perungues, franges oua octo et agitabis. perfundes, subtus supra cinerem calidam habeat. coctam piper minutum asparges et inferes.

### English Translation
**Patina of nettles, hot or cold**: Take nettles, wash them, strain through a colander, dry on a board; cut them up. Grind 10 small measures of pepper, moisten with fish sauce, rub together. Then add 2 cups of fish sauce, 6 ounces of oil. Let the pot boil; when it has boiled, remove the cooked nettles so they cool; then grease a clean dish, break 8 eggs and beat them. Pour over, place over hot ashes to cook from below and above. When cooked, sprinkle with finely ground pepper and serve.

â€”*Apicius*, 4.2.36, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** Nettles and other wild greens (*herbae rusticae*) were an important part of the Roman diet, especially for rural and lower-class Romans. These plants could be gathered freely from the countryside and provided valuable nutrition. Despite their humble origins, dishes made with these ingredients also appeared on the tables of the wealthy, as evidenced by their inclusion in Apicius' cookbook. This patina recipe transforms nettles into a sophisticated egg custard that could be served either hot from the oven or chilled as a cold dish, demonstrating the versatility of Roman cooking.

### Ingredients
- 250g nettles, spinach, or other leafy green
- 20ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 30ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 6 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}

### Method
1. Wash and coarsely chop the greens. Add to a frying pan along with the fish sauce, olive oil, and a generous quantity of ground pepper, and cook.
2. Once the leaves are wilted, remove from the heat. Drain any excess liquid if present, then return the leaves to the frying pan.
3. Beat the 6 eggs, then pour over the leaves. Return the frying pan to the heat and cook until the bottom is cooked. Then either flip the omelette, or alternatively place the frying pan under the broiler to allow the top to cook. Serve either hot or cold.
