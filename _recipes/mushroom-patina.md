**Claude's intro:** This simple mushroom dish represents a type of preparation Romans called *patina* (or *patella*), which typically involved ingredients bound together with eggs, similar to a modern frittata or omelet. Mushrooms were highly prized in Roman cuisine, especially the *boletus* variety mentioned in this recipe, which likely refers to what we now know as porcini mushrooms. The Romans were avid mushroom foragers and consumers, though they were also well aware of the dangers of poisonous varieties. This recipe combines the earthy flavor of mushrooms with the sweet-savory balance typical of Roman cuisine through the addition of honey and fish sauce. The lovage adds an aromatic, celery-like note that complements the mushrooms beautifully, creating a dish that would have been considered both nutritious and luxurious.

### Ingredients
- 300g of mushrooms, thickly sliced
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %} leaf
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 4 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}

### Method
1. Place the mushrooms, olive oil, fish sauce, honey, lovage, and black pepper into a frying pan. Cook briskly until the mushrooms are cooked, and the sauce has entirely reduced down.
2. Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them smooth. Pour over the mushroom mixture, and cook gently until the eggs have set. If needed, you can either flip the patina or place under the broiler in order to make sure that the top is cooked.
