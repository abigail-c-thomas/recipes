### Ingredients
- 300g of mushrooms, thickly sliced
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %} leaf
- ½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 4 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}

### Method
1. Place the mushrooms, olive oil, fish sauce, honey, lovage, and black pepper into a frying pan. Cook briskly until the mushrooms are cooked, and the sauce has entirely reduced down.
2. Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them smooth. Pour over the mushroom mixture, and cook gently until the eggs have set. If needed, you can either flip the patina or place under the broiler in order to make sure that the top is cooked.
