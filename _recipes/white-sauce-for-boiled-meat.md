# White Sauce for Boiled Meat

### Original Text
*Ius candidum in elixam: piper liquamen uinum rutam cepam nucleos conditum, modicum de buccellis maceratis unde stringat, oleum. cum coxerit, ius perfundis.*

### English Translation
White sauce for boiled meat: pepper, fish sauce, wine, rue, onion, pine nuts, *conditum* (spiced wine), a little soaked bread to thicken it, and oil. When it has cooked, you pour the sauce over [the meat].

—*Apicius*, 7.6.4, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This versatile white sauce from Apicius represents a sophisticated approach to meat preparation in Roman cuisine. The sauce combines richness from pine nuts and bread, pungency from rue and fish sauce, sweetness from honey, and a foundation of wine—creating a complex flavor profile characteristic of elite Roman dining. Unlike modern gravies which often use the meat's own fat as a base, this sauce relies on bread as a thickening agent, a technique that remained popular in European cuisine for centuries. The pairing of carefully boiled meat with elaborate sauces was typical of Apicius, where the sauce often received more attention than the protein it accompanied.

### Ingredients

* 800 g cut of beef, lamb, or pork suitable for slow cooking  
* 50 ml \+ 40 ml fish sauce  
* 200 ml white wine  
* 2 pieces of bread, crust removed  
* 1 brown onion, peeled and cut in half  
* 60 g pine nuts  
* 1 tsp rue  
* 2 Tb honey  
* 1 Tb oil  
* Ground pepper

**Method**

1. Place the meat in a saucepan along with 50 ml of fish sauce and half of the brown onion. Add enough water to cover the meat, then simmer with the lid on for 2 hours, or until the meat is cooked and falling apart. Check periodically to make sure enough water remains, and add more if needed.  
2. Once the meat is cooked, take 100 ml of the cooking liquid and pour onto the bread to soak for a few minutes.   
3. Add the bread, the remaining 40 ml of fish sauce and half an onion, along with the pine nuts, rue, honey, oil, and a generous helping of ground pepper to a food processor. Process until smooth.  
4. Pour the sauce into a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, or until the onion flavour mellows. Adjust with fish sauce or honey as desired.   
5. Carve the meat, and serve smothered in the sauce.

**Notes**

* You can add vegetables like carrots or parsnips to the meat as it cooks, and serve as side dishes  
* Any leftover cooking liquid can be used as stock for other recipes - for instance, to cook barley or lentils. If you like, you can add herbs (such as parsley, coriander, or bay leaf) while cooking the meat to further enhance the flavour of the stock.
