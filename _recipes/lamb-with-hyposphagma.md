# Lamb with Hyposphagma

### Original Text
<!-- TODO: Add original Greek text from Athenaeus 516c -->

### Ingredients
- 1.5 kg boneless leg of {% include ingredient_link.html name="lamb" %}
- 400 ml pig's {% include ingredient_link.html name="blood" %}
- 100 g fresh {% include ingredient_link.html name="goat cheese" %}
- 3 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}
- 1½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- A pinch of {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- 1½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="salt" %}

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F. Roast the leg of lamb for about 90 minutes, or until cooked to the desired doneness. Once cooked, remove from the oven, cover in aluminium foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.
2. While the lamb is resting, prepare the sauce by adding the remaining ingredients into a saucepan and whisking them together until thoroughly combined.
3. Place the saucepan on the stove and bring to just below a simmer, whisking constantly to prevent the blood from congealing. Taste and adjust the flavors as desired, and then continue gently cooking for a few minutes as the sauce thickens.
4. Once the sauce has thickened and the lamb rested, carve the lamb and serve with some of the sauce poured over.

### Notes
- The original recipe appears in Athenaeus's *Deipnosophistae* ("Banquet of the Learned"), where he quotes an otherwise unknown work by Erasistratus.
- The term *hyposphagma* literally refers to "under-blood" and was used for sauces made with blood.
- While blood might seem unusual to modern tastes, blood sauces were common in ancient cuisine and remain traditional in many cultures today.
- If pig's blood is unavailable, this dish can be prepared with a thick red wine reduction, though the flavor and texture will differ significantly.
