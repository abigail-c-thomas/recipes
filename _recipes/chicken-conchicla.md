# Chicken Conchicla

### Original Latin
*Aliter conciclam sic facies: concidis pullum minutatim, liquamine oleo et uino ferueat. concidis cepam coriandrum minutum, cerebella eneruas, mittes in eundem pullum. cum coctus fuerit, leuas et exossas. concides minutatim cepam et coriandrum, colas ibi pisam coctam non conditam. accipies conciclarem, pro modo conponis uarie. deinde teres piper, cuminum, suffundis ius de suo sibi. item in mortario oua duo dissolues; temperas, ius de suo sibi suffundis. pise integre elixe uel nucleis adornabis, et lento igni feruere facies et inferes.*

### English Translation
"Another way to make conchicla: Cut the chicken into small pieces, and let it simmer in fish sauce, oil, and wine. Chop the onion and coriander finely, remove the membranes from brains, and add them to the chicken. When it is cooked, lift it out and debone it. Chop onion and coriander finely, and strain cooked peas without seasoning into this. Take a conchicla dish, and arrange the ingredients in layers as appropriate. Then grind pepper and cumin, and pour in the broth from the chicken. Also, dissolve two eggs in a mortar; mix them, and pour in the broth. Garnish with whole cooked peas or pine nuts, and cook over a slow fire, then serve."

—*Apicius*, 5.4.5, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This layered dish from Roman cuisine combines tender chicken with peas and aromatics, bound together with an egg mixture to create a substantial casserole-like preparation. The name "conchicla" appears to refer to a specific type of Roman layered dish. The modern adaptation simplifies the original recipe by omitting brain tissue while preserving the essential technique of creating distinct layers and binding them with an egg mixture enhanced with spices.

### Ingredients
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken {% include ingredient_link.html name="thighs" %}  
- 250g split {% include ingredient_link.html name="peas" %}  
- 200 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}  
- 60 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="onion" %}, diced  
- A handful of fresh {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} leaf, chopped  
- ½ tsp ground black {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}  
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}  
- 2 {% include ingredient_link.html name="eggs" %}  
- A handful of {% include ingredient_link.html name="pine nuts" %}

### Method

1. Place peas in a saucepan along with 750 ml of water. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for about 1 hour, or until the peas are mushy and thick.  

2. While the peas are cooking, place the chicken thighs in a pot with the wine, fish sauce, olive oil, half the onion, and half the coriander. Bring to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes. Remove the chicken from the cooking liquid and shred with a fork. Use a strainer to separate the onions from the cooking liquid, reserving both.  

3. Once the chicken and peas are cooked, preheat the oven to 150°C/300°F. Assemble the conchicla in a 1.5L baking dish by first lining the bottom with the shredded chicken. Next place the onions on top, and then layer the mushy peas on top, patting down flat.  

4. Beat the eggs with the cumin, pepper, and 60 ml of the reserved cooking liquid. Gently pour on top of the conchicla, and then decorate with the pine nuts.  

5. Place the conchicla in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the top layer is set. Remove from the oven and serve.
