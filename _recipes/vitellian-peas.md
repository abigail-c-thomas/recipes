# Vitellian Peas

### Original Text
> Pisam Vitellianam siue fabam: pisam coques, lias. teres piper ligusticum gengiber, et super condimenta mittis uitella ouorum quę dura coxeris; mellis uncias III, teres, liquamen uinum et acetum. haec omnia mittis in caccabum et condimenta quae triuisti. adiecto oleo ponis ut ferueat. condies pisam, lias; si aspera fuerit melle mittis et inferes.

"Vitellian peas or beans: Cook the peas and puree them. Grind pepper, lovage, and ginger, and add hard-boiled egg yolks over these seasonings; grind 3 ounces of honey, fish sauce, wine, and vinegar. Put all of these in a pot along with the seasonings you have ground. Add oil and bring to a boil. Season the peas and puree them; if they are too rough, add honey and serve."

—*Apicius*, 5.3.5, c. 4th century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** This elegant Roman dish features a creamy pea purée combined with fragrant spices and enriched with egg yolks. The dish is named "Vitellian," which might refer to the emperor Vitellius (who briefly ruled in 69 CE) or perhaps to the word "vitellus" (egg yolk), which is a key ingredient in this recipe. The combination of legumes with exotic spices like ginger demonstrates the Roman talent for transforming humble ingredients into sophisticated dishes. The attention to texture—suggesting the addition of honey if the mixture is too rough—shows the Roman concern for palatability and mouthfeel, a hallmark of elite cuisine throughout the Empire.

### Method

1. Place peas in a saucepan along with 750 ml of water. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for about 1 hour, or until the peas are mushy and smooth.  

2. Crush the egg yolks in a mortar and pestle. Add the ginger, generous pepper, and honey and pound again. Add the vinegar, fish sauce, and white wine, and mix until smooth.  

3. Pour the yolk mixture in with the peas along with the olive oil, and stir to combine. Gently heat for a few minutes and then serve.

### Notes
This recipe comes from *Apicius*, a collection of Roman recipes compiled in the late 4th or early 5th century CE. The combination of egg yolks with the puréed peas creates a rich, creamy texture, while the spices and condiments add complex layers of flavor.
