# *Lucanicae*

### Original Text
*Lucanicae: lucanicas similiter ut supra scriptum est. [lucanicarum confectio]: teritur piper cuminum satureja ruta petrosilenu condimentum bacae lauri liquamen et admiscetur pulpa bene tunsa ita ut denuo bene cum ipso subtrito fricetur; cum liquamine admixto pipere integro et abundanti pinguedine et nucleis inicies in intestinum perquam tenuatim productum et sic ad fumum suspenditur.*

### English Translation
**Lucanicae**: These are prepared in the same way as described above. [To make Lucanicae sausages]: Grind together pepper, cumin, savory, rue, parsley, bay berries, and fish sauce, and mix with well-pounded meat so that it is thoroughly combined with the ground spices. Then mix in fish sauce, whole peppercorns, plenty of fat, and pine nuts, and stuff it into a very thin sausage skin. Then hang it in the smoke.

—*Apicius*, 2.4, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** Lucanicae were popular Roman sausages named after their supposed origin in Lucania, a region of southern Italy. This recipe from Apicius demonstrates the Roman love of highly seasoned preserved meats. The combination of aromatic herbs, spices, and fish sauce (garum) created a distinctive flavor profile that would have helped mask any off-flavors in the meat while extending its shelf life. The smoking process mentioned in the recipe was an important preservation technique in the ancient world before refrigeration. Roman Lucanicae sausages are considered ancestors of many modern Mediterranean sausage varieties, showing how these preservation and flavoring techniques have endured throughout culinary history.
