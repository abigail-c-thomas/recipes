This simple recipe showcases Roman cooking techniques for leafy greens. While the original recipe was likely intended for wild foraged greens common in ancient Italy, it works beautifully with a variety of modern greens like spinach, chard, or mustard greens.

### Ingredients
- 500 g fresh leafy vegetables (e.g., {% include ingredient_link.html name="spinach" %}, {% include ingredient_link.html name="chard" %}, {% include ingredient_link.html name="mustard greens" %})  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- 2 tsp white wine {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}  
- Ground black {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}  
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}  
- 10 small grains of {% include ingredient_link.html name="mastic" %} gum

### Method
1. Wash and chop the leafy vegetables as desired.

2. Crush the mastic gum in a mortar and pestle. Place all of the ingredients into a frying pan and saute the greens until cooked, adding a little water if desired.
