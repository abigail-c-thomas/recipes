# Fried Chickpeas

### Original Text
> Aliter faseolus siue cicer: frictos ex oenogaro et pipere gustabis. et elixati sumpto semine cum ouis in patella, feniculo uiride piper et liquamine et careno modico pro salso inferuntur, uel simpliciter, ut solet.

"Another way to prepare beans or chickpeas: You will taste them fried with wine sauce and pepper. Or taking boiled seeds with eggs in a pan, they are served with green fennel, pepper, fish sauce, and a little reduced wine instead of salt, or simply, as is customary."

â€”*Apicius*, *De Re Coquinaria* 5.8.2, 4th-5th century CE

- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 3 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="wine" %}  
- Freshly ground black {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}

### Method
1. Heat the olive oil in a skillet. Add the chickpeas and fry until they are golden brown.

### Notes
This recipe is adapted from Apicius, a collection of Roman culinary recipes compiled in the late 4th or early 5th century CE. The original recipe also mentions an alternative preparation with eggs and fennel, but this version focuses on the simpler fried method with oenogarum (a sauce of wine and fish sauce).
