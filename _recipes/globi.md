# Globi

### Original Text
*Globos sic facito. Caseum cum alica ad eundem modum misceto. Inde quantos uoles facere facito. In ahenum caldum unguen indito. Singulos aut binos coquito uersatoque crebro duabus rudibus, coctos eximito, eos melle unguito, papauer infriato, ita ponito.*

### English Translation
"Make globi thus: Mix cheese with spelt in the same way [as for libum]. From this, make as many cakes as you want. Place lard in a hot bronze vessel. Cook one or two at a time and turn them frequently with two sticks; when cooked, take them out, coat with honey, sprinkle with poppy seeds, and serve thus."

â€”*Cato*, *De Agricultura* 79, c. 2nd century BCE

**Claude's intro:** Globi (meaning "spheres" or "balls") are simple cheese fritters that were popular in ancient Rome. This recipe comes from Cato the Elder's agricultural manual and creates sweet, fried cheese balls that are then coated with honey and poppy seeds. The combination of crispy exterior, soft interior, and sweet honey coating makes these a delightful dessert.

### Ingredients
- 240g {% include ingredient_link.html name="ricotta cheese" %}  
- 120g {% include ingredient_link.html name="semolina" %} (or bread flour)  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="lard" %}, for frying  
- 80 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="poppy seeds" %}

### Method
1. Mix the cheese and flour in a large bowl, then form into 32 small balls.

2. Add enough lard to a small frying pan or saucepan to generously coat the bottom of the pan when melted. Place the pan on medium heat, and once the lard is hot add one batch of the balls. Turn them frequently in the hot lard until golden on all sides and cooked through. Remove to a plate with a paper towel to remove any excess fat.

3. Fry the remaining balls in batches, adding more lard if needed to the pan.

4. Once all the have been fried, dip them in honey, sprinkle with poppy seeds and serve.
