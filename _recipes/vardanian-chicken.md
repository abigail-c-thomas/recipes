# Vardanian Chicken

### Original Text
*Pullum Vardanum: pullum quoques iure hoc: liquamine oleo uino fasciculum porri coriandri satureiae; cum coctus fuerit teres piper; nucleos ciatos duos et ius de suo sibi subfundis et fasciculos proicies. lac temperas et reexinanies \[in\] mortarium supra pullum, ut ferueat. obligas eundem aluamentis ouorum tritis, ponis in lance et iure supra scripto perfundis. hoc ius candidum appellatur.*

Vardanian chicken: Cook the chicken in this sauce: fish sauce, oil, wine, a bundle of leeks, coriander, and savory. When it is cooked, pound pepper and two measures of pine nuts, pour in some of its own broth, and throw away the herb bundles. Mix in milk and pour it back into the mortar over the chicken so it heats up. Thicken with beaten egg whites, place on a plate, and pour the above sauce over it. This sauce is called white sauce.

â€”*Apicius*, 6.8.11, c. 4th century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** This elegant Roman chicken dish features a creamy white sauce made with pine nuts, milk, and egg whites. It's an excellent example of the sophisticated cooking techniques employed by wealthy Roman households. The name "Vardanian" might refer to a place or person, though its exact origin is unknown.

### Ingredients
- 6 chicken thighs
- 1 leek
- 1 bundle of coriander leaves
- 1 tsp savory
- 400 ml wine
- 60 ml fish sauce
- 2 Tb olive oil
- Pepper
- 100 g pine nuts, ground
- 250 ml milk
- 3 egg whites

### Method
1. Place the chicken thighs in a dutch oven along with the wine, fish sauce, olive oil, and savory. Wash leek and coriander leaves, then place them on top without chopping. Bring to a simmer, then cook with the lid on for 25 minutes.
2. Remove the leek and coriander leaves from the pot, then add the pine nuts, milk, and a generous amount of pepper. Beat the egg whites with a fork, then pour them over, making sure to stir so that they don't immediately curdle. Gently heat until the sauce thickens and begins to break, then serve.

### Notes
This is one of several "white sauce" recipes in Apicius. The egg whites create a silky texture while the pine nuts add richness and body to the sauce.
