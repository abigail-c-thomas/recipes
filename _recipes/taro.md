# Taro

### Original Text
Relevant text from Apicius 7.15:

> In colocasio: piper ligusticum coriandrum rutam suffundis acetum, adicitur caryota, mel, aceto, liquamen, defrito et oleum modice, temperabis. cum fervere coeperit, obligas. colocasium ut supra facies.

"For taro: pepper, lovage, coriander, rue; moisten with vinegar; add date, honey, vinegar, fish sauce, reduced wine, and a little oil; you will mix together. When it begins to boil, thicken. Prepare the taro as above."

—*Apicius*, 7.15, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** Taro (*colocasium* in Latin) was a vegetable introduced to Rome from Egypt, where it was widely cultivated along the Nile. This recipe demonstrates how Romans incorporated exotic ingredients into their cuisine through trade networks that spanned the Mediterranean. The thickened sauce with its complex sweet-savory flavor profile—combining honey, fish sauce, and aromatic herbs—complements the starchy texture of taro root. Similar sauces appear in various Apicius recipes, showing the Roman preference for assertive flavorings that transform simple ingredients. The technique of thickening sauces was common in Roman high cuisine, creating luxurious textures that enhanced the dining experience.

### Ingredients
- 400 g {% include ingredient_link.html name="taro" %}  
- ½ tsp ground black {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}  
- 1 tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}  
- 1 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="rue" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 1 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="honey" %}  
- 2 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}  
- 60 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="water" %}  
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cornstarch" %}, made into a slurry

### Method
1. Peel and cut the taro into large cubes. Place in boiling water and cook for 12–15 minutes, or until cooked but not too mushy, then drain.

2. Mix the remaining ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the cornstarch to thicken, then pour over the taro and serve.

### Notes
Last time I made this the taro turned to mush.
