# Simple Roman Peas

### Original Text
*aliter pisam siue fabam: despumatam subtrito lasare Partico liquamen et careno condies. oleum modice superfundis et inferes.*

### English Translation
Another preparation for peas or beans: When skimmed, season with ground Parthian *laser* (asafoetida), fish sauce, and *caroenum* (reduced wine). Pour a moderate amount of oil over and serve.

—*Apicius*, 5.3.7, c. 4th century CE

___

**Claude's intro:** This minimalist pea recipe from Apicius demonstrates the straightforward approach Romans sometimes took with everyday legumes. While many Roman recipes feature complex combinations of herbs and spices, this version relies on just a few powerful flavoring agents. The asafoetida (called laser Particum in Latin) was an expensive imported resin that added a distinctive pungent, savory note similar to garlic and onions. Combined with fish sauce (garum) and reduced grape must (defrutum), these few ingredients transformed simple peas into a dish with depth and complexity. This recipe shows the Roman talent for balancing simplicity with powerful flavors.

### Ingredients
- 250g split {% include ingredient_link.html name="peas" %}  
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}  
- 3 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 3 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}  
- 3 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method

1. Place peas in a saucepan along with 750 ml of water. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for about 1 hour, or until the peas are mushy and thick.  

2. Add the remaining ingredients to the saucepan. Stir, make adjustments to the flavour as needed, and serve.

### Notes
This simple Roman pea dish comes from Apicius. It features asafoetida (silphium/laser), which was a popular seasoning in Roman cooking that imparts a pungent, savory flavor similar to garlic and onions. The combination with fish sauce, reduced wine (defrutum), and olive oil creates a rich and flavorful dish despite its simplicity.
