# Simple Roman Peas

## Roman Dish from *Apicius*
*Apicius 5.3.7*

### Ingredients
- 250g split {% include ingredient_link.html name="peas" %}  
- Â½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}  
- 3 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 3 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="defrutum" %}  
- 3 Tbsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method

1. Place peas in a saucepan along with 750 ml of water. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for about 1 hour, or until the peas are mushy and thick.  

2. Add the remaining ingredients to the saucepan. Stir, make adjustments to the flavour as needed, and serve.

### Notes
This simple Roman pea dish comes from Apicius. It features asafoetida (silphium/laser), which was a popular seasoning in Roman cooking that imparts a pungent, savory flavor similar to garlic and onions. The combination with fish sauce, reduced wine (defrutum), and olive oil creates a rich and flavorful dish despite its simplicity.

### Translation
"Another recipe for peas or beans: Once skimmed, season with ground Parthian laser [asafoetida], fish sauce, and reduced wine. Pour a little oil on top and serve."
