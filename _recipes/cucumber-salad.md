# Cucumber Salad

### Original Text
> Aliter cucumeres: piper puleium mel vel passum liquamen et acetum. interdum et silfi accedit.

"Another way with cucumbers: pepper, pennyroyal, honey or raisin wine, fish sauce, and vinegar. Sometimes silphium is also added."

â€”*Apicius*, 3.6.3, c. 4th century CE

**Claude's intro:** This refreshing cucumber salad showcases the Roman love for sweet-sour-savory flavor combinations. The addition of honey or passum (raisin wine) balances the acidity of the vinegar, while the herbs and fish sauce add complexity.

### Ingredients
- 1 {% include ingredient_link.html name="cucumber" %}, thinly sliced  
- 60 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="passum" %} (raisin wine)  
- 30 ml white wine {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}  
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}  
- 2 tsp dried {% include ingredient_link.html name="pennyroyal" %}  
- A couple pinches of {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}  
- Ground black {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}

### Method
1. Arrange the cucumber slices in a shallow dish. Combine the other ingredients together and pour over the cucumber. Cover the dish with cling wrap and leave in the fridge for a couple of hours.

### Notes
The recipe calls for either *passum* or honey. If using honey rather than passum add 2 Tbsp honey.

The recipe itself states that adding *silphium* is optional, so you can omit this if you like.
