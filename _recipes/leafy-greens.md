Claude's intro: This rustic herb salad demonstrates the Romans' approach to serving foraged wild greens, which were an important part of their diet. The recipe showcases the typical Roman dressing of fish sauce, oil, and vinegar - a combination that formed the foundation of many Roman dishes. The addition of pepper, cumin, and mastic berries (resin from the lentisk tree) provides aromatic complexity. Wild herbs and greens were valued not only for their flavors but also for their medicinal properties, reflecting the Roman understanding of food as medicine. The mention of serving "by hand" likely refers to eating these herbs raw as we would a modern salad.

### Ingredients
- A mixture of wild herbs and greens (sorrel, purslane, dandelion, etc.)
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="vinegar" %}
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- Ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- Mastic berries (or a pinch of mastic powder)

### Method
1. Wash and dry the wild herbs and greens thoroughly.
2. Mix together the fish sauce, olive oil, and vinegar to create a dressing.
3. Either serve the herbs with the dressing on the side for dipping ("by hand"), or place them in a dish and drizzle with the dressing.
4. Sprinkle with ground pepper, cumin, and crushed mastic berries before serving.

### Notes
- "Herbae rusticae" refers to wild, foraged greens rather than cultivated vegetables - modern equivalents might include wild arugula, dandelion greens, sorrel, purslane, and other edible wild plants.
- Mastic berries come from the lentisk tree (Pistacia lentiscus), which grows throughout the Mediterranean. Today, mastic resin is still used in Greek and Middle Eastern cooking.
- Wild greens were an important part of the Roman diet, particularly for rural and lower-class Romans, but they were appreciated by all social classes for their flavors and health properties.
- The option to serve "a manu" (by hand) or "in patina" (in a dish) shows the versatility of this preparation - it could be served as a finger food with dipping sauce or as a dressed salad.
