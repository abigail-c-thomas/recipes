# Sauce for Boiled Fish

### Original Text
*Ius in pisce elixo: piper ligusticum cuminum cepulam origanum nucleos careotam mel acetum liquamen sinapi oleum modice. ius calidum. si uelis, uuam passam.*

### English Translation
Sauce for boiled fish: pepper, lovage, cumin, onion, oregano, pine nuts, date, honey, vinegar, fish sauce, mustard, a little oil. [Serve as] a hot sauce. If you wish, [add] raisins.

—*Apicius*, 10.1.2, c. 4th century CE

___

**Ingredients**

* ½ tsp ground pepper  
* ½ tsp lovage  
* 1 tsp cumin  
* ½ tsp oregano  
* ½ small onion, finely diced  
* 20 g pine nuts  
* 1 tsp ground mustard seed  
* 2 Tb date syrup  
* 2 Tb honey  
* 2 Tb vinegar  
* 2 Tb fish sauce  
* 1 Tb olive oil

**Method**

1. Mix everything into a small saucepan, bring to a simmer, then serve with the fish.

**Notes**

* Makes enough for 750 g of fish  
* This is similar to a number of the other sauces. *Vinidarius* 18, which differs only in having celery seed rather than onion, is particularly close, but *Apicius* 10.2.4/10.3.1, 10.2.6, 10.2.11, and 10.2.16 are all similar, as are a number of sauces in Book 6, 7, and 8\.
