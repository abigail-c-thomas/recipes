### Ingredients
*For marinade:*
- 1 kg {% include ingredient_link.html name="pork" %} belly
- 1½ tsp ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %} leaf
- 3 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="dill" %} seed
- 3 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %} seed
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="asafoetida" %}
- 2 {% include ingredient_link.html name="bay berries" %}
- 45 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}

*For sauce:*
- 150 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="passum" %}
- 30 ml {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- ½ tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="lovage" %}
- Generous ground {% include ingredient_link.html name="black pepper" %}
- 1 Tb cornstarch, made into slurry

### Method
1. Dry roast and grind the seeds in the marinade, then combine with the lovage, asafoetida, and fish sauce
2. Place the meat skin side down. Score the meat by cutting through the meat down to, but not through, the skin, in parallel lines 3 cm apart. Then cut meat orthogonally, again not cutting through the skin, to get a grid of 3cm x 3cm squares. Cover the meat with the marinade and place covered in the fridge for 3 days.
3. Once the meat has marinated and you are ready to cook it, preheat the oven to 190C / 375F. Rub a little olive oil over the meat, and place on a roasting tray. Roast for 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until the meat is well-done and can be easily pulled from the skin. Once cooked, take out to rest while you prepare the sauce
4. Place the *passum*, fish sauce, lovage, and pepper in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Simmer for a few minutes, then add the cornstarch slurry to thicken.
5. Cut the meat into pieces, and serve with the sauce.
