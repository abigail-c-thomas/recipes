# Cabbage with Onion

### Original Latin
*Aliter coliculos: elixatos in patina conpones. adicies in mortario piper rutam coriandri semen cepa bullisse, suffundes liquamen, uino et passo temperabis, effundes super coliculos et inferes.*

### English Translation
Another way [to prepare] cabbage sprouts: boil them and arrange in a dish. Put in a mortar pepper, rue, coriander seed, and onion; moisten with fish sauce, mix with wine and passum, pour over the cabbages and serve.

â€”*Apicius*, 3.9.2, c. 4th century CE

___

This cabbage dish showcases a more complex flavor profile than the basic preparation, with the addition of onion and sweet passum (raisin wine). The method of grinding the aromatics and spices into a sauce before combining with the cabbage ensures that the flavors permeate the vegetable thoroughly. The combination of savory, sweet, and aromatic elements demonstrates the sophisticated approach to vegetable cookery in Roman cuisine, transforming humble cabbage into a dish worthy of the dining table. The stir-fry method used in this adaptation also helps to maintain the cabbage's texture better than boiling alone.

### Ingredients
- 300g {% include ingredient_link.html name="cabbage" %}, chopped into thin strips
- 1 brown {% include ingredient_link.html name="onion" %}, diced
- {% include ingredient_link.html name="pepper" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="cumin" %}
- 1 tsp {% include ingredient_link.html name="coriander" %} seed
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="passum" %}
- 1 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="fish sauce" %}
- 2 Tb {% include ingredient_link.html name="olive oil" %}

### Method
1. Add the cabbage and onion to a wok or frying pan along with about 100 ml of water. Cook for 5 or so minutes, until the cabbage is tender and the water has evaporated.
2. Add the remaining ingredients to the wok, toss everything together, and serve.

### Notes
- The original recipe doesn't call for fish sauce, or indeed any source of salt, which appears to be an omission.
- Recipe 3.9.3 is very similar, as is 3.9.1a.
- The use of passum (raisin wine) adds sweetness to balance the savory elements of the dish.
- This quick stir-fry method preserves more of the vegetables' texture and nutrients than the prolonged boiling often used in Roman cooking.
