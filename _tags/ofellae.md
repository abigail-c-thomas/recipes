# Ofellae

*Ofellae* is a Latin word referring to marinated bite-sized pieces of meat that have been cooked in a richly-flavoured sauce. We have ten surviving recipes for *ofellae*â€”six from Apicius, Book 7, and a further four from Vinidarius.

The dish involves a two-step cooking process. The meat is first slowly roasted or boiled, and then afterwards quickly "fried" in a flavorful sauce. The final dish should be succulent and tender, somewhat similar to modern BBQ or braised dishes.

*Ofellae* were a staple of taverns, and the Emperor Claudius even rhetorically asked "Who can life without *offulae*?" in a Senate discussion on cookshops.
