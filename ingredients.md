# Ingredients Guide

## Asafoetida {#asafoetida}
Also known as hing, this spice has a strong garlic-like flavor when raw but becomes much milder when cooked. It's commonly used in Indian cuisine and is an excellent substitute for garlic and onions.

## Bay Leaf {#bay-leaf}
Fresh or dried leaves from the bay laurel tree. They impart a subtle flavor to dishes and are typically removed before serving. Common in Mediterranean cuisine.

## Caraway {#caraway}
A spice with a distinct earthy anise-like flavor. The seeds are commonly used whole or ground in both savory and sweet dishes.

## Chicken {#chicken}
A domesticated bird that was commonly eaten in the Roman Empire. While modern chickens are much larger than their ancient counterparts, the cooking methods remain similar. Both whole birds and specific cuts can be used according to the recipe.

## Date {#date}
Sweet fruits from the date palm tree. Common in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine, they were used both as a sweetener and as a fruit.

## Fish Sauce / Garum {#fish-sauce}
A fermented fish sauce fundamental to Roman cooking. Modern substitutes include Asian fish sauce, Worcestershire sauce, or a mixture of anchovy paste and salt.

## Honey {#honey}
A natural sweetener widely used in ancient cooking before the widespread availability of sugar. Different honey varieties can impart distinct flavors.

## Lovage {#lovage}
An herb with a strong celery-like flavor. If unavailable, celery leaves can be used as a substitute.

## Mastic {#mastic}
A resin from the mastic tree with a pine-like flavor. It was commonly used in Roman cooking and is still used in Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine. Can be omitted if unavailable.

## Black Pepper {#black-pepper}
Black peppercorns were a highly valued spice in ancient Rome. They were typically ground fresh and used both during cooking and as a table condiment.

## Saffron {#saffron}
The dried stigmas of the crocus flower, providing a distinct flavor and golden color. It was a luxury spice in ancient times and remains one of the world's most expensive spices.

## Silphium {#silphium}
An extinct plant that was highly prized in ancient Roman cooking. Modern recipes typically substitute asafoetida or a combination of garlic and fennel.

## Wine {#wine}
A fundamental ingredient in Roman cooking, used both as a beverage and a cooking liquid. For cooking, medium-dry white wine is often recommended as it's closest to Roman wines, though red wine can also be used.
